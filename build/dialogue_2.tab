30001	붕괴되기 전날 밤을 꼬박 샜어요…
30002	At 14:07:47, the Honkai outbreak took effect at Senba Academy. Estimated odds of survival are 0.000000001%
250001	<i>Tuuu, tuuu...</i> The number you are dialing is currently not available. Please leave a message after the beep.
250002	(O) Beep--
250003	Hey. It's me, Kiana. I am currently at Senba Academy in Nagazora, in the Far East. I know you must be going after this Honkai outbreak. Just know that I will find you, no matter where you go!
250004	(O) Boom!
250005	Huf... I talked enough. I didn't expect this outbreak to happen so suddenly. It should be a small outbreak. Let's assume the range covers the entire Senba Academy grounds.
250006	Next, I just have to find the target before 「Schicksal」arrives - this time, I'm not letting them get away!
250007	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
250008	Honkai infected zombies are already roaming... Good thing I made sure to prepare weapons in advance.
250009	<i>Click-tchack</i>
250010	Weapon inspection done. It seems fine. I have ammo... I really don't know how long these old guns will last.
250011	Well~ Regardless, let's follow the plan and get out of this library.
250012	I expected it, but there really are zombies on the escape route...
250013	Human beings, infected and mutated by the Honkai... with no more emotions, no more consciousness. //nLike walking corpses. Such sad creatures.
250014	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
250015	I'm sorry. Even still, I can't show you mercy.//n As a final favour, I will help you sleep in peace.
250016	<i> Click- BANG- BANG- BANG!---</i>
250017	<i>Phew-</i> I finally made it out of the library. So far so good. I should follow this plan, and find the target in the disaster area A.S.A.P.
250018	I'm currently here, and I should try to avoid places where zombies are crowded. Then the most effective route would be along Sakurakouji into the center of Senba Academy campus. Let's do it!
250019	Still... The usually loud and bustling academy feels so quiet now. It's really hard to get used to. Well, from now on, I don't have to try and be ladylike and accompany the other ladies to enjoy the flowers. That's one happy thing to come out of this, for now.
250020	Ah, hold on! Now's no time to get emotional! Obviously, there are more important things to deal with right now!
250021	<i> Pip pip pip </i>
250022	Ooh! The detector on my phone found something, let me see~ There is reading for a Honkai energy source at 2 o'clock, 700 meters from here... Humph- That must be the center of this Honkai outbreak! The target must be there too!
250023	Hehe- Though I can't call you or anyone with the phone you left me, the extra features sure are effective. He probably never expected I would use this feature he designed himself to find him.
250024	All right, let's stick to the original plan!
250025	The Honkai energy source is 50 meters away now... I should be close enough to see it now.
250026	It should be right there- Tsk. Indeed, there are a lot of zombies gathered over there. Even for this girl, dealing with so many will be a challenge.
250027	Though, most zombies are dumb enough to move towards anything that makes a sound. If I use this weakness to my advantage, I can make things easier for myself.
250028	Looks like we'll have to take a detour. First, I should make a sound to attract their attention, and then go around and approach from the left side.
250029	(O) Bang!!
250030	Eh?! Wha?! What was that sound? I haven't done anything yet! Uh... Thunder?! But it was sunny just now, why did it suddenly...
250031	(O) *Zombies roar*
250032	Uh... whoops. They saw me.
250033	Ah, forget it. In that case, breaking through is the only option!
250034	<i>Hah, hah-</i> There's no end to them. I hadn't expected the zombies to come swarming to the Honkai source here. It will be a bit of a problem if this keeps going.
250035	Almost out of ammo, almost out of time... I have to find the target, fast.
250036	(O) *Weird sound*
250037	Who's there?!
250038	That figure doesn't seem like a zombie... could it be?! I finally found you! Wait!
250039	(O) ……
250040	Eh?! This is... a student? I didn't think there were still people who hadn't been infected by the Honkai...
250041	Your uniform, it's the one used for senior students. What's your name?
250042	(O) ……
250043	Hey, are you not all there? Could you like maybe... answer?
250044	(O) ……
250045	Ah... Maybe you're too scared to talk? That's okay... I can't help you right now, so you'd better find a place to hide somewhere.
250046	<i>Graaaaah!!</i>
250047	Gee, it's not safe here! If you've given up on trying to survive, then nobody can help you. Even if I take you with me, you'll just slow me down. Goodbye, don't blame me.
250048	(O) ……
250049	(O) *Zombies roar*
250050	Ugh! Just my luck. Come with me!
250051	<i>Huf...huf...</i> Seems like escorting a normal person whilst fighting zombies is a bit much... Hey, you okay?
250052	(O) ……
250053	<i> Tsk </i> I'm such an idiot. Why did I help this girl? She doesn't even say a word of thanks. And I've been busting my butt off!
250054	Just stay here. This is the old school building. The zombies won't find it for a while. I'm not staying here to help you anymore. You'll have to fend for yourself.
250055	........Why did you help me?
250056	Eh? You finally said something?
250057	A person like me should die... Maybe even being born was a mistake...
250058	Ha? What are you on about? How could someone even say that about herself?
250059	Just leave me be. You can stop pretending to care. You just approached me because of the name 'Raiden Mei'.
250060	'Raiden Mei'? I think I've heard that name before... Isn't she a celebrity in Senba Academy? The daughter of the president of ME Company! Is that you?
250061	(O) ……
250062	Oh... The same rich girl who is said to have rejected 12 boys in one day and earned the nickname 'Thunder Queen'. Yet you're looking so ashamed and dejected. What a rare sight.
250063	Are you just going to mock me too? Sure enough, everyone's rotten on the inside.
250064	Don't be mistaken, I'm not here to laugh at you. I just mean to say that instead of blaming other people or being angry at the heavens, it's better to find ways to change yourself instead.
250065	Change? That's right... It's not me who is the problem, it's this sickening world! This deceitful world should be destroyed!
250066	Uh, that doesn't seem right... Hello?! What happened to you?!
250067	(O) Bang!!!
250068	Huh? What is going on with this weather? Could it be some sort of abnormal effect caused by the Honkai outbreak?
250069	(O) *Phone rings*
250070	Gee, for the phone to react at this moment...okay! Detected high Honkai energy reading... Distance 0 meters?
250071	(O) *Beep*
250072	Huh? The signal broke? Why would this phone fail at such a critical moment! Isn't 0 meters away right next to me? There's nobody here except for a troubled rich girl!
250073	If this deceitful world is destroyed... All can return to how it was before... My father... everyone... will surely return to me.
250074	Hey, where are you going! Wait for me!//n(TN: Couldn't undestand the middle sentence, check multilanguage)
250075	(O) Bang!!!
250076	So annoying! Where did that girl go? Really... Why should I waste so much time on this stranger!
250077	And the amount of zombies keep increasing. If we go any further, we're going to be in serious trouble.....?
250078	(O) *Zombies roar*
250079	Hehehe, everyone is with me. As long as I have my father, and everyone I care about, then nothing else matters.
250080	There she is! Oh no! That girl is surrounded by zombies!
250081	(O) *Sound of firing*
250082	You bastards! Leave that girl alone!!
250083	Who are you? Have you come to ruin my happiness again?
250084	What kind of nonsense is that? I'm here to save you!
250085	Go away! I don't need your pity.
250086	(O) *Zombies roar*
250087	Ugh, what's going on with the zombies surrounding her?
250088	Everything... Everything should just DISAPPEAR! //n<size=30>(TN: This doesn't translate well to english, but in JP it's "everything... Everything everything everything should just DISAPPEAR!")</size>
250089	Hey! Where are you going?! Dammit... when I'm done cleaning up these zombies, I'll have to teach that unstable missy a lesson. //n(TN: she's specifically referred to as a 'lady'/ojousama in Japanese)
250090	Finally, I caught up!
250091	Wait for a bit. Father, just a little longer... and Mei can become what you want her to be.
250092	What's going on with her? It's like she became a different person.
250093	And the way the zombies are acting... They're so close, but instead of attacking her, they slowed down and started following her...?
250094	Ahhh~ What a joyous feeling. Everyone, the whole world, is with me... No one will abandon me anymore, everyone will enjoy the happiness of eternity by my side!
250095	Hahaha~ Raiden Mei, let me help you make your desires a reality.
250096	Why do you look like that?! You're not Raiden Mei! Who are you?!
250097	Hahahaha~ Cute little kitten, it doesn't matter who I am~ Because soon, you will become a burnt corpse and join the rest of them.
250098	(O) Bang!!
250099	Woah! How did lightning strike all of a sudden?!
250100	Ohoho~ Well done avoiding that. It seems like you will be good practice for me. Let me torture you slowly~
250101	Who the hell are you?! Nobody outside of the Kaslana bloodline can survive in this Honkai heavy environment!
250102	Hah. It no longer matters who I am. Raiden Mei no longer exists, and I am here to bring this wretched world to its destruction in her place!
250103	(O) Bang!!
250104	The lightning energy is coursing through her... If this is a phenomenon caused by the Honkai, could she be absorbing the Honkai energy around her?
250105	So there are human beings in this world that can directly manipulate Honkai energy without external help. It's the only possible explanation I can think of...
250106	Ah, I think this could be pretty bad... But it's too early to be all doom and gloom! If you think about it from another angle, maybe I'll end up being the world's saviour!
250107	I have to find a way to stop her!
250108	Hah! Such spirit! Let's see you give it a try!
250109	(O) *Zombies roar*
250110	Out of my way!
250111	Hmph! That was careless of me. To think I would be tricked by a little girl like you. Looks like I will need to absorb more power-
250112	I won't let you!
250113	Eh?! What are you up to?!
250114	The Kaslana family bloodline is completely resistant to the Honkai! If my body can withstand the Honkai, I can cut you off from the source of your Honkai energy!
250115	Asshole! Stay away! Don't touch me!
250116	<i> UUUrgh </i> A surge of Honkai... directly into my body. This is the first time I've felt this much energy- It hurts!!
250117	Please... Help...
250118	Father! Please help... Don't leave Mei!
250119	This is... a piece of consciousness passed on through the Honkai energy?
250120	Father! Why did you leave me?! Why does everybody hate me?! Why?! Why?! Why?!
250121	This world can be damned for all I care!
250122	Don't pry into my heart!
250123	Ack!
250124	Damn it! I just need more power, then no one can hurt me anymore!
250125	Wait, stop! You're being taken over by the Honkai! If you absorb more Honkai energy, you will lose your mind! If that happens, it might be too late!
250126	Humph~ Don't tell me such ridiculous lies! I can see right through you, you're the same as the rest of them! They were jealous of my status and family, and you are jealous of my power!
250127	I will never forgive you... Just you wait!
250128	Hey, wait! Don't run away!
251063	There's a thunderstorm ahead... This should be the right way.
251064	But where am I now?  It's a place I've never seen, but... Was there really a place like this at the school?
251065	And this is an abandoned building, isn't it? It doesn't seem right for such a run-down building to be in such a modern academy...//n(TN: A bit verbose, maybe it's better to redo it closer to EN?)
251066	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251067	Hmm? That sound is... a motorcycle?
251068	Does that mean some humans still survived?
251069	No, the only person that should have been able to survive is Mei, and she was a special case. Could it be that this sound is.....
251070	Ha! You really are going after this Third Eruption in secret! Now that I found out that you're here, you're not getting away!
251071	I didn't expect there to be such a deserted place in this academy.
251072	And what's this smell... Yeesh, it's awful...  No way, is all the chemical wastewater and contaminated water from the school ending up here...?
251073	(O) ……
251074	The world-famous academy is doing something illegal like this... It's got a gorgeous appearance, but it's polluting the city behind that façade.
251075	There's even a warning sign to prevent people from entering. I wouldn't have seen this for the rest of my life if I didn't try following those engine sounds.
251076	If it wasn't for the Honkai, this might have been hidden forever.//n(TN: CN/JP changed the sentence, CN used "If it wasn't for me finding this...")
251077	Pretty on the outside, but rotten on the inside... Is that what human nature is like? Is that what our world is like?
251078	I can't understand it.
251079	<i>Vroooom- Vrom vroooom-</i>
251080	...Ah! That sound is right around the corner! I won't let you escape this time!
251081	This place is disgusting... It stinks and it's hard to walk and that engine sound keeps attracting zombies. That person doesn't seem bothered by it all. Well, I'm just a tender girl, and I have girlish needs, okay?
251082	When I find the guy with the motorcycle- If it really is the guy who left me behind- I will beat the crap out of him!
251083	(O) Ah… What's this…
251084	This motorcycle... it can't be the motorcycle I just heard, right?
251085	Well, it can't be him. He's still a warrior of the Kaslana family, he wouldn't make such a low level mistake.
251086	Let's follow the blood trail and investigate. Too bad there's still no clue as to where he is. It's disappointing.
251087	This person... should be the owner of the bike from earlier, right?
251088	You're heavily injured... Are you still suffering this pain, even after becoming a zombie?
251089	You don't have to bear it anymore. Rest in peace!
251090	<i>BANG!</i>
251091	Once, you were a human too. But you no longer are...
251092	You wimps. You succumbed to the end way too easily.
251093	But I, Kiana Kaslana, will never bow down to the Honkai!
251094	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251095	This sound! It's the same sound from before!
251096	You can hide as well as you like, I will find you!
251097	Phew... Finally, somewhere normal. If I had stayed there any longer, I would have suffocated.
251098	This seems to be a winding road.
251099	Where have I ended up this time...
251100	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251101	This... is it the motorcycle I heard before?
251102	It's getting closer!
251103	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251104	That's the motorcycle?! And the person riding it-
251105	Humph, there's a dead end up there, you're not getting away!
251106	Hey, what's with this note? It wasn't here before...
251107	This handwriting is really sloppy.
251108	...It says "Help me"?
251109	So the person on the motorcycle definitely isn't him... Kaslanas are never corrupted by the Honkai.
251110	Ah, but it's no time to be thinking about that guy. Right now I should be saving someone!
251111	Let me see... Around here... Ah, that is...
251112	...a girl? And that's the motorcycle?
251113	So it really wasn't him. I had hoped to find at least a sign of him.
251114	But, why isn't she moving? Hey, are you okay over there?!
251115	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251116	Damn... She doesn't give me the vibe that she's still human.
251117	Oh? She's not driving towards me? Does she still have some consciousness left?
251118	A bunch of cars just drove past... Most of them were sports cars...
251119	Is this a road race? Is this the track?
251120	It seems like the scope and range of the outbreak isn't that large, at least this place seems to be unaffected.
251121	<i>Craaash!</i>
251122	What happened?! Where was that explosion?!
251123	I can see black smoke up ahead... Could it be a car accident?
251124	Hey, hey hey! Even if this place is pretty deserted, you still have to abide by basic traffic rules!
251125	Ah, I can guess what happened. They probably became zombies while they were racing, so they crashed.
251126	<i>Vrooom~vrom vrom vrom vrom vrom~</i>
251127	There's no road up ahead! Why does it sound like she's still accelerating?!
251128	She... drove off the cliff...
251129	What happened...
251130	Huh, this book? It looks like a diary. Did that girl leave this behind? Let's have a look.
251131	<color=#ffd7b3>01/05: My motorcycle is finally here! I am going to name her Thunderbolt, because she will be as fast as lightning!</color>
251132	<color=#ffd7b3>01/06: I joined the motorcycle club at school! I didn't think Senba Academy would have such a club! Senpai told me I am the most talented person she's ever met, and she said she likes me a lot...</color>//n
<color=#ffd7b3>She's the first person who didn't judge me because of my looks.</color>
251133	<color=#ffd7b3>01/13: Our motorcycle club has accepted a challenge from the racing club. A battle between motorcycles and sports cars.</color>//n
<color=#ffd7b3>We met on the empty mountain road behind the ruins. It is said that nobody has come here for five years, and that there used to be some urban legend of the God of Racing.</color>
<color=#ffd7b3>They laughed at my looks, but my speed shut them up.</color>
251134	<color=#ffd7b3>02/02: Our club has won a lot of matches. Senpai said that I was born for biking. I'm so happy.</color>
251135	<color=#ffd7b3>03/13: Tomorrow, there will be another match. I made a deal with Senpai. If I win, she will consider studying to attend a local school.</color>//n
<color=#ffd7b3>It's really hard to enter a school in Nagazora. But if I win, she will try really hard for me.</color>
251136	This poor girl... If it weren't for the Honkai, she would be having a match with her Senpai right now.
251137	At the end, when she was being torn apart and corrupted by the Honkai, did she hang on because of her attachment to her Senpai? That's why there was that 'Help me' note...
251138	I don't know what this girl looks like, but I think she's beautiful. Unlike way too many people.
251139	In this world, there are people who look ugly, but who have a pure heart. I take back my negative comments earlier about everyone in the world......
251140	<i>Rumble...</i>
251141	This thunder...
251142	Damn, almost forgot I was still in this outbreak. I should be tracking down Raiden Mei right now.
251143	Let this girl rest. At least she died with her Senpai close to her heart.
251144	Unfortunately, Mei's quite a handful~ I still have to find her, and fast!//n(TN: It's something like "unfortunately unlike her, senpai is quite a handful!)
250129	(O) Bang!!
250130	Stormy clouds are now gathering above the main school building... Raiden Mei also left in that direction. The weather changes are definitely also her doing.
250131	He once told me there is a special kind of large scale Honkai outbreak, a cataclysm that can destroy the entire planet... But the scariest part is not the outbreak itself, but the creature born from the outbreak...
250132	A human body saturated with Honkai energy, stripped from a human mind. It becomes an entity made only for destruction and ruin. It is the strongest monster created by the Honkai- The Herrscher.
250133	Given the current situation, it is very likely that this is the case here.
250134	I never expected this outbreak to turn into something this big, and I'm worried I might be in over my head.
250135	Forget it... It's pointless to dwell on it any longer, I just hope things don't take a turn for the worse.
250136	Since I had already resolved myself to face the Honkai from the start, I won't let go of this opportunity! He should also be nearby and going after the same goal as me. And Raiden Mei, she must be at the center of this outbreak.
250137	To defeat this troublesome senpai, I'm afraid brute force alone won't do the trick. Those feelings that flowed to me through the Honkai energy earlier, those might be the key to waking her up.
250138	(O) *zZZZZ*
250139	Agh, this useless phone... It keeps beeping at the worst times, stop it!
250140	I don't need an alert to tell me there's a huge vortex of storm clouds looming overhead, and there are zombies everywhere... I can easily tell this place is super bad news.
250141	If I really end up dying here this time... No! Bad! I shouldn't be thinking so negatively. I, Kiana Kaslana, won't fall so easily!
250142	That's right! Until I find him, I can never give up!
250143	Haha~ Lovely little Kohai, you really are determined to die, aren't you? It is really touching~ As a reward for you, I'll give you a chance to share your last words.
250144	Last words? Then let me tell you a story about a senpai of mine.
250145	(O) ……?
250146	She lost her mother when she was very young, and has never felt a mother's love. And her father, he treated her like a tool, cultivated her to be the heir of his company.
250147	In order to live up to her father's expectations, this senpai worked hard to be better than anyone else. She gave up her opporunity to live happy and carefree like other girls her age. She suffered on her own accord, and she drove herself into a corner. All of it to be the most amazing person, so that her father would love her and treat her as a daughter.
250148	(O) Shut up!
250149	When she went to school, the senpai earned the love and respect of her teachers and classmates with her excellent grades and lovely appearance.
250150	But still, she did not get her father's approval. Slowly, senpai gave up all hope. It didn't matter if she was no more than a tool, at least her classmates and her teachers would acknowledge her. But then, a month ago something happened that shattered her hopes and dreams.
250151	Stop talking!! Don't make me remember those things!!!
250152	(O) Bang!!!
250153	Senpai's father was arrested after committing economic crimes with his company, and he lost his original social status. Senpai, she thought her classmates and teachers would try to comfort her. But they treated her completely differently.
250154	It turned out the world was not as friendly as she had thought, and the people around her had only flattered her because they feared her grand halo.
250155	After losing all these things, she became nothing. She couldn't even be her father's tool anymore.
250156	Don't act as if you know me so well!! It's true, I have nothing left, everyone betrayed me! But I don't need them anymore!
250157	Even if I am alone... In can survive in this world of Honkai! The power I wield is the proof of how valuable I am!
250158	<i>The mind that was being suppressed by the Honkai finally seems to be resurfacing. If she can completely recover herself, that should be enough to save her.</i>
250159	(O) Mei! I know your feelings! You worked so hard for your dream, but you were abandoned by others at last……
250160	But you have to live! Not for the name Raiden Mei, or your father's family business, not for the goodwill, mercy, or charity of others! Live for yourself!
250161	(O) For myself…
250162	Mei-senpai! Come and grab my hand! I will help you get rid of the Honkai in your body!
250163	Can I really trust you?
250164	Yes! I swear! I won't deceive you!
250165	You are the first person to reach out to me like this... Thank you.
250166	(O) But… It's too late.
250167	Mei-senpai?!
250168	This girl can't turn back anymore! She will become the goddess of death that brings destruction to this world!
250169	It's you! You're the other personality created by the Honkai! Get out of Mei-senpai's head!
250170	<i>Ha ha...</i> When I completely overtake her spirit, you won't stand a chance!
250171	You asshole! Get back here!
250172	Damn it, almost succeeded... This is so frustrating! That <i>thing</i> from before seems like it has taken control over Mei's body.
250173	It's getting darker, and it will become more and more dangerous the longer this goes on... I've deviated a lot from the original plan, but I've chosen this path. I must finish this!
250174	When the city lights went dim, I realised that the night sky is so mesmerising. If it weren't for the thunderclouds above me, the view would be amazing~
250175	(O) …… Sometimes I have this thought: Which part is broken, the world?　Or us?
250176	Please... Stay away, leave me be! I can't suppress it anymore. I don't want to be its puppet!
250177	Mei-senpai! Don't give up! Don't let the Honkai consume you!
250178	No... I'm too tired to keep on living, and I don't have the strength to fight anymore. If I die now, perhaps I will find peace.
250179	Senpai! What are you doing?!
250180	Thank you ... I'm glad I met you at the end. Jumping here now seems to be the best choice I can make.
250181	Don't--!!
250182	(O) ……
250183	She jumped down. In the end, I didn't make any difference! And I was so close!
250184	(O) ……
250185	(O) ……
250186	Ha ha ha ha!
250187	(O) !?
250188	What are you so sad about? I finally obtained this body, would I really let it die so easily?
250189	You again!
250190	Hee he he~ Don't worry, Raiden Mei will not be alone, I will always be with her~ And I will fulfill all of her wishes.
250191	First of which: Simply killing you, you annoying school girl!
250192	As if! I'll definitely bring her back!
250193	Impossible... I was actually defeated by such a human...
250194	Senpai! Senpai! Wake up!
250195	I'm alive...
250196	Wouldn't it be okay to let a person like me die? Why would you risk your life to save me?
250197	Hu~ I don't know. When you shared your thoughts with me, I recognised a little of myself in them. Maybe I just did it for myself.
250198	Can you tell me your name?
250199	Kiana Kaslana. I'm just a school girl who happened to pass by for personal reasons.
250200	What a strange person...
250201	To me, Senpai is also a strange person! Actually being able to survive such a violent Honkai outbreak. And there is stil...
250202	What is it?
250203	No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it Senpai~ It's over now.
250204	Just call me Mei. This 'Honkai' you just mentioned. Is that the name of this disaster?
250205	Well~ It's a bit of a headache to explain this problem. On the surface, Honkai is as you can see: A phenomenon that leads to the destruction of the world and the demise of mankind.
250206	(O) …?
250207	The world ending Honkai, whether you can accept it now or not, is a phenomenon that occurs periodically. Right now, human knowledge cannot explain what the cause is, and it can only be said to be an unpredictable disaster.
250208	It can take many forms: Wars, infectious diseases, climate disasters, meteor strikes... Even godlike warriors can suddenly appear.
250209	For example, a recent large-scale Honkai outbreak, the Black Death in the 14th century, directly or indirectly caused the destruction of one third of the world's population.
250210	Then, what was eroding my body just earlier?
250211	That is the source of Honkai energy, which will accompany the Honkai, and it is an energy that can distort the rules of the world. It's presumed to be an indispensable element for causing the Honkai, and the nature of its existence is also hard to get a read on.
250212	However, it seems to have a significant tendency towards consciousness, though that's not in any of the records. Maybe something similar has happened before, that was then classified.
250213	Has it left me now?
250214	I don't know it either. Maybe it left, or maybe it's sleeping inside of Mei-senpai somewhere. But I think as long as Mei-senpai stays strong willed and sticks to her heart, it will definitely not reappear~
250215	Mh, thank you.
250216	Hey~ You're welcome! As a partner, this is a must~
250217	Partner? This is the first time someone considers me a partner.
250218	Mei-senpai? What's wrong?
250219	It's nothing, there is a feeling in my heart that I have never had before. But, can someone like me really become a companion? I killed them, I wanted to curse the world. I...I...
250220	No, all of that wasn't Mei-senpai's fault. It was the Honkai enacting judgement upon humanity.
250221	In my opinion, there is no absolute good and evil in this world. There was never such a thing before, and I don't think there ever will be in this broken world.
250222	Because of your will, you managed to survive. Those who are weak, who gave up their belief in survival, have long since become zombies. No matter what kind of beliefs you hold, to survive is the most meaningful thing.
250223	Can I really be your partner?
250224	Please watch my back, and fight beside me.
250862	It looks like it's just the two of us left in the entire academy. This is just like in a movie...
250863	Surely enough, it's all because of me.. Ah! Kiana, why did you pinch my face?
250864	That's punishment for a certain Senpai who can't stop blaming herself for everything. I've already told you that the people who didn't survive didn't do so because they lost their will.  In my opinion, it doesn't make a difference whether they are alive or not.
250865	Still though, I can't just accept that...
250866	 Mei-senpai! This is no longer the peaceful world you're used to! This entire place has been swallowed by the Honkai. If you can't change your mentality, you will be swallowed by the Will of the Honkai too!
250867	But... It's far too sudden. I need time to adjust.
250868	That's okay~ It's okay to get used to Honkai and stuff. You can take your time.//nAnd... Senpai, you're actually pretty cute like this~
251394	Kiana is quite good at making people smile.
251395	Ehehehehehe-
250869	All right, I'll work towards it slowly! But right now, our primary goal is escaping this academy, right?
250870	Well, right now the academy is full of zombies, so walking out the front door is pretty much the worst option. We have to think of another way to leave.
250871	Kiana, why don't you let me take the lead? I'm quite familiar with this lab building, there's a passage leading to the side entrance of the academy.
250872	Ah! Isn't this the restricted area of the academy? Even if you're a third-year, you wouldn't have had any opportunity to come here, would you?
250873	Well, it's true that this is one of the forbidden areas of the school, but that's only for students in general. For me, it's not as restrictive.
250874	In fact...this laboratory, and even this academy, was funded and built by my family's business. And my father, Raiden Ryoma, was the biggest contributor to promoting the establishment of Senba Academy.
250875	How fitting for ME Corp, to be able to build a whole Academy City.
250876	It's just a smart electronics company, it's not a big deal.//nAnyway, our primary goal now is to escape the academy, right?
250877	Okay~ Okay~ Then I should ask Miss Raiden to swiftly take me away from this hellhole.
251396	(O) Mei?
251397	Hm? What's the matter, Kiana?
251398	Ah it's nothing, it's just that you looked sad so I wanted to ask you what's wrong.
251399	It's nothing... I'm just... Thinking of my father.
251400	I remember when I was still a kid, my father would always be doing experiments, as if experiments were all he ever had ......
251401	I was tutored by the private teachers that my father hired, and I've never had any friends. The only person that I could talk to was my Kendo teacher.
251402	When I got older, I wanted to question my father about that, but he vanished.
251403	Vanished... You mean...?
251404	Missing, whereabouts unknown.
251405	(O) Just like mine…
251406	(O) Kiana?
251407	My dad also vanished, so that's why I came to Chiba Academy, to look for him.
251408	Looks like we're in the same boat then.
251409	Yeah, should we call this alliance the "Girls' Alliance of Looking for Our Missing Dads"?
251410	What kind of name is that?
251411	Ehehehehe~
251412	The temperature is also getting lower and lower, it feels like entering a freezer...
251413	The experiments here seem a little strange, it seems a bit different from the ones my father was doing.
251414	Experiments? Looks pretty standard to me... Specimens, biochemical symbols, stuff like that. More like, this place gives off serious laboratory vibes~
251415	Additonally, there seems to be a logo above all the lab doors we just passed... It's bugging me...
251416	Logos? What logos?
251417	That one.
251418	Maybe it's a logo from your company? Don't worry about it, senpai~
251419	Mmmh, that's probably right.
251420	I remember passing through the front warehouse to exit through the side door.
251421	Sssh!
251422	Senpai, did you hear anything?
251423	...<i>shuffle</i>....<i>shuffle</i>...
251424	This sound- Could the zombies be coming after us?
251425	No, that's not what zombies sound like. It was more like the sound of an animal moving, and it came from the direction of the warehouse.
251426	How can there be animals in a place like this... How about we go and have a look?
251427	Well, I have a feeling that if we turn back now we'll just be faced with more zombies so... let's go check the warehouse out!
250898	Mei-senpai! Did you see that?
250899	Um... What is that?
250900	Not sure... It slipped away. Let's follow it and find out!
250901	Hold on! We don't want to get hurt if we rush after them. Let's act calmly and make a plan.
250902	(O) Ha?
250903	How could there be a person there? Kiana, didn't you say that that was the sound of an animal?
250904	(O) I… I don't know…
250905	Is she whispering to someone?
250906	There isn't anyone else here, just zombies, so is she talking to herself?
250907	No, look in front of her, there's a girl lying there.
250908	<i>pip pip pip...</i>
250909	Dammit, why is it buzzing now of all times!?
250910	What!? There's a strong Honkai Energy reaction 20 meters ahead. Isn't that-!?
250911	Kiana, I think she saw us! She's looking our way. Her face is so pale... And...
250912	Senpai, what did you see? Why are you trembling?
250913	(O) She has tails……
250914	Tails? That's not good... Looking at her, she's probably also able to control Honkai Energy. We need to get out of here, fast!
250915	Phew~ It should be safe here.
250916	Mmmh, we're not far from the side entrance of the academy...
250917	Calm down, Senpai. Are you concerned about what we just saw?
250918	Well, I keep feeling like there's something more to her... And that girl lying there.
250919	Kiana, why don't we go back and investigate?
250920	No! This place is too dangerous!
250921	(O) ……
250922	(O) And…
250923	Okay~ I understand~ Maybe Kiana is really right... I'm being too reckless.
250924	Let's go, I'll get you out of this Academy City...
251145	……
251146	(O) Mei…?
251147	(O) Kiana, I just thought about that thing. I feel we might get involved in some weird cases…
251148	(O) We can't go back in this situation!
251149	(O) Why? Don't you want to know what happened to this girl?
251150	(O) No… You know Houkai level is different,if…
251151	(O) Fiddle-de-dee……
251152	(O) ……
251153	(O) What happened, Kiana?
251154	(O) Houkai energy detected, the level of this Houkai… Should be that "person". I think you are right, Mei. We got involved in some strange cases.
251155	(O) Does it mean that person know we are leaving, so she is waiting us at the side door?
251156	Well, I don't know what the other side is thinking, but it seems better to give up on escaping from the school for the time being . . .
251157	(O) Fiddle-de-dee……
251158	(O) No! She found us! She is moving to us! We must leave here!
251159	(O) Where are we now?
251160	Let's see...... I know, this is one of the academy's forbidden areas. It seems that this is an abandoned schoolhouse. I hear that ghosts come out here from time to time...
251161	Ha, I don't believe that! There shouldn't be any ghosts here. But if it's a forbidden area, there might be less zombies... Maybe it's safer?
251162	Are there fewer zombies in a forbidden area?
251163	(O) Yes?
251164	(O) I always feel there is someone following us.
251165	(O) Oh no, must be that thing!
251166	Ki, Kiana, Aren't there less zombies here? Why are we surrounded by zombies?!
251167	I think she's attracting the zombies.
251168	She... You mean that girl with a tail?
251169	Right! They're reacting to the source of the Honkai. The source of Honkai is not only collecting Honkai energy, but also zombies together. Moreover, because it absorbs the Honkai energy fast, the power becomes stronger as time passes. (tn: redo this)
251170	(O) So… I think it will be wrose if we continue running…
251171	(O) We were planned to escape, now we come back to this place again, we need to do something!
251172	(O) Maybe we should talk to her first! I'm also very interested in her~
251173	(O) Kiana, you are just like a knight now~
251174	(O) And one more thing… I don't have much ammo.
251175	(O) Cough…
251176	(O) Did you hurt her?
251177	(O) Hum?
251178	(O) Do you mean the girl lay in front of you?
251179	(O) So, you know her?
251180	(O) …
251181	(O) If no, I think the talk is over.
251182	(O) Fox, you can't run so easily, why did you chase us? And who are you? Why did you attract those zombies?
251183	(O) Who am I? I don't know that either…
251184	(O) I didn't mean to hurt you, I haven't seen a lot of normal human. I just want to get more information.
251185	(O) You seems have some special emotion to the girl?
251186	(O) Special emotion? Maybe, because she slept with me/
251187	(O) Wait a second? You slept together?
251188	(O) Kiana, shut up, let her finish talking, I think, she has some stories~
251189	(O) That was a rainy night. She came to my shrine, without umbrella, I was a little fox that time. She hold me a whole night, kept me warm.
251190	(O) So, we got closer and closer… However!
251191	(O) I think, she got human body by Houkai energy.
251192	(O) Because she missed the dead girl so much, after got Houkai energy, she controlled it, just like me.
251193	(O) Yes. However, the Houkai energy is still affecting you. You will lose control sometime.
251194	(O) Ah, although I don't know your name, but Miss Palefox, I just want to say, you are in danger.
251195	(O) However, you don't need to take it. Just give me your Houkai energy. Then you can go back to the old times.
251196	(O) No way! My life has changed since I met her…
251197	(O) You should know, when I found her, she was just lay there. She dead before the Houkai explosion.
251198	(O) Before I figure out what happened, I won't listen to you!
251199	(O) Wait a second, let me explain… Hey!
251200	(O) She… Disappeared?
251201	(O) Kiana…
251202	(O) What happened, Mei?
251203	(O) Nothing, I'm just thinking, will we find Miss Palefox? We stayed here for a long time…
251204	(O) Relax~ Although the phone is bad, but we can use it~
251205	(O) Fiddle-de-dee……
251206	(O) Look, what did I say?
251207	(O) What a magical machine, the person who invented it must be very eruditely……
251208	(O) I don't know whether he is eruditely or not, but he likes running everywhere.
251209	(O) Oh? Do you know him well?
251210	(O) Not really, but he is my… I don't want to talk about him… We'd better find the fox and clear the Houkai source on her.
251211	(O) Yes.
251212	(O) Let's go, Kiana.
251213	(O) Walk along this road, we can meet a shrine. I don't know if it is the shrine Miss Palefox mentioned.
251214	(O) Ah? Do you know this place before?
251215	(O) Humph, I came here before… When I was a little girl, with my father……
251216	(O) I see… What kind of person is your father? Although I saw him in your memory, but I didn't see much about him.
251217	(O) My father… He is a strict person.
251218	(O) However, he took you to this place. I think, he loves you, maybe he just don't know how to represent it.
251219	(O) How about Kiana? What kind of person is your father? If I'm right, he made this phone for you.
251220	(O) Humph…… About my father, I don't know him very much, I just know he took me away from Shicksal. He taught me some skills and knowledge, however, he left me alone here…
251221	(O) "Shicksal"? Where is it?
251222	(O) Ah… I spoke too much…
251223	(O) Nothing. Forget about it~ You said there is a shrine, let's check it, maybe we can find some clues~
251224	(O) Oh…
251225	(O) You are trying to find me, why are you doing this?
251226	(O) If we can't do it, you will… Why are you pulling me?
251227	(O) Let me talk to her.
251228	(O) …
251229	(O) We just want to help you.
251230	(O) Help me?
251231	(O) Help me find the answer you need.
251232	(O) Mei~ We still have a lot of things need to do, how can we figure out things like it?
251233	(O) Kiana, give me some time. I know, she knows everything, she just can't accept it. Am I right, Miss Palefox?
251234	(O) You, what are you saying!
251235	(O) That girl, you know what happened to her, you know that very well.
251236	(O) I don't know……
251237	(O) I don't know…… It's you, you, you… Don't want to control me!
251238	(O) Watch out! Mei! She acts weird!
251239	(O) Why?! If I can understand her words earlier…
251240	(O) Do you always remember what she said to you?
251241	(O) No, I just recall that part.
251242	(O) Before the Houkai explosion, I was just a normal arctic fox, lived in this shrine for a long time.
251243	(O) I couldn't understand human language that time, but I can remember what she said to me. Now, I finally can understand her.
251244	(O) Her parents lived overseas so she lived in academy. She doesn't have much friends in the academy.
251245	(O) When she felt sad, she went to this shrine. She always brought some food to feed animals here.
251246	(O) I always sit with her under the eave, she talked to me when she touched me.
251247	(O) Her grade was poor, she dreamed become an author. Her parents gave her a lot of stress, push her do things she doesn't like.
251248	(O) She felt so sad, she disliked it. She wanted a different life.
251249	(O) Until some days later, I hadn't seen her. However, I waited here day bu day…
251250	(O) She cried at the last day, I could't understand her that time. Is she leaving to find her parents or?
251251	(O) After the Houkai explosion, I got a human body and I finally knew her meaning.
251252	(O) She said…
251253	(O) If the world breaks tomorrow morning when she wakes up, evereyone can be themselves, what a wonderful world…
251254	(O) What happened to her?
251255	(O) Now, I think I know her, I don't need to keep this body, you can let me turn back to a fox.
251256	(O) Seriously?
251257	(O) Humph.
251258	(O) ……
251259	(O) Hey! I don't believe that.
251260	(O) You! You again!
251261	(O) Tell you something, this fox is mine, don't try to stop me! Otherwise I will beat you all!
251262	(O) Stop running!
251263	(O) Kiana, what happened to Miss Palefox?
251264	(O) Mei, do you remember the Houkai energy in your body?
251265	(O) Is that thing trying to control her body?
251266	(O) Humph, maybe. That thing is affecting her now.
251267	(O) I was thinking she just acted weried. She must be fighting with the Houkai energy that time.
251268	(O) It's complicated now. Houkai energy in her body is much stronger than you.
251269	(O) It's not a big deal if you can help me.
251270	(O) Me?
251271	(O) Yes, just like that time, catch the chance and beat her!
251272	(O) I don't know whether I can do it but I will try!
251273	(O) Finally, you arrived here? I have been waiting you for a long time!
251274	(O) Give me your Houkai source~ Stupid human beings~ This Houkai explosion will end you all!
251275	(O) Mei, are you ready?
251276	(O) …… Humph!
251277	(O) Miss Palefox! I don't know whether you can hear or not, but I still have something need to say to you!
251278	(O) It's useless, she can't hear you now. I'm taking charge of this body now!
251279	(O) Miss Palefox! No matter how the world changes, don't forget to follow your heart!
251280	(O) I said it's useless, you can stop trying those things! Just let me control you!
251281	(O) In this crazy world, would you like to see the girl lay on the cold ground?! Do you remember you said you want to protect her forever?
251282	(O) Hahaha, that's stupid…… Errrr!
251283	(O) Kiana, now!
251284	(O) I will handle it!
251285	(O) It's useless…… You can't stop the Houkai explosion…
251286	(O) ……It's not up to you!
251287	(O) ……
251288	(O) She… is arctic fox now…
251289	(O) Because she is not controlled by Houkai energy, she can't keep the human body.
251290	(O) *Sob*
251291	(O) Miss Palefox?
251292	(O) Mei, her body is turned to arctic fox, she can't understand you.
251293	(O) *Whisper*
251294	(O) Got it, see you~
251295	(O) Ha!? Can you understand her?
251296	(O) Yes, she said she is going to protect that girl, she won't let zombies get close to her until the last second of her life.
251297	(O) She is so good… I don't know why there are so many bad people……
251298	(O) Just "some" people, I believe, in most people's heart, kind still exists.
251299	(O) Maybe…… But, when did you get the ability to understand animals?
251300	(O) That's not a special ability~
251301	(O) I was lonely before so I got a miniature heart……
250229	It's strange. Even though we've left the university city, we're still in the range of Honkai.
250230	Kiana, can I ask you something?
250231	Hmm? What is it?
250232	We're not lost, are we?
250233	No way, we're on the right track! I've got everythin under control!
250234	So.... Why are we walking on the overpass?
250235	(O) Relax~ It's the "Fast Lane" and we also can avoid zombies.
250236	I understand what you're saying, but ... it's hard to walk on this road ...
250237	(O) Alright, we can have a rest here, you can see the university city from here, it's a nice view~
250238	Oh, I'm not dissatisfied!  Now that I've decided to go with Kiana, I'm ready!
250239	(O) Well, I'm also a little bit tired too, just have a rest~
250240	Thank you ... But you don't have to treat me like a rich lady. I want to help Kiana-chan as much as possible.
250241	I don't treat you as a young lady!  Besides, I was surprised that Mei-senpai had the knowledge of swordsmanship!  It's been a big help!  !!
250242	(O) ……It's my family skill "Hokushin Itto-ryu", I didn't expect I can have chance to use it soemday…
250243	(O) Stop here, let's go! We still have a long way.
250244	(O) Wait! Mei! Can we rest for a little longer?
250925	(O) Kiana, did you feel anything weird?
250926	(O) What's wrong? Mei~
250927	(O) The Houkai is already happened, why there is still a train moving?
250928	(O) Hu~ Maybe it's just lost control…
250929	(O) I hope so, but did you find there was always a train moving while we are fighting with mecha girls…
250930	(O) Do you mean there is some relationships between the train and Mecha girls?
250931	(O) Yes, although I can't promised that, but I can feel there is soemthing wrong with that.
250932	(O) Are they trying to protect the train, maybe there is some important thing on the train.
250933	(O) *Sound of mobile phone vibration*
250934	(O) Oh! My phone is ringing… A lot of Houkai energy is coming to us… It's so fast!
250935	(O) Kiana! Look, there is a training moving to us!
250936	(O) Yeah, maybe here will be some Mecha girls, let's find a place to hide and watch them!
250937	(O) Got it!
250938	(O) *Sound of train*
250939	(O) … Errr, I didn't see any Mecha girls~
250940	(O) Kiana, wait! Don't go outside!
250941	(O) Relax~ Relax~ It's already safe……
250942	(O) Bang!!
250943	(O) Wow!
250944	(O) They are coming! Kiana, let's go!
250245	(O) Kiana! How about you?
250246	(O) What's wrong with this place, endless zombies and weird enemies!
250247	(O) Seems this way is not as safely as we thought before.
250248	(O) Fine~ Mei, we should find a place to hide first!
250249	Oh, look over there!  There is a derailed vehicle!  Let's hide in that!  As expected, there is too little shielding here, which is a disadvantage!
250250	(O) ……
250251	(O) What happened, Mei?
250252	(O) Those marks on the mecha are…
250253	(O) Marks? Forget about it! We need to run now!
250254	(O) Emmmm…
250255	(O) Hohoho~ We are safe now.
250256	(O) Those marks are so familiar to me……
250257	(O) Mei, what are you thinking since that time, is there anything special with the mark?
250258	(O) Do you remember the marks on the laboratory building walls? I saw it on those Mecha, does it related to ME Co., Ltd……
250259	(O) Mei, I remember your family business is about electronic manufacturer? Those rebots should beyond it…
250260	(O) That's too weird, so is the laboratory, so are the Mecha girls… What did father do?
250261	(O) *Phone rings*
250262	(O) Ha? Phone rings… I thought it was broke, let me see…
250263	(O) Houkai source detected, 1000 meters… 800 meters… 600 meters… It's so fast, no way.
250264	(O) Mei, let's go, we need to escape the Houkai area first, let's consider the relationship between ME Co., Ltd and marks.
250265	(O) Kiana, look…
250266	(O) What happened this time? If it's about marks…
250267	(O) Bang!!!
250268	(O) Errrr!! What's that!?
250269	(O) White rebot? It's much bigger than those Mecha girls and I saw a human on that rebot.
250270	(O) Wait! It's back again! We need to retreat  first! Seems it's not so friendly!
250271	(O) 2 lives detected, Houkai energy detecting.
250272	(O) No… It's chasing us!
250273	(O) A… Little kid with that rebot?
250274	(O) Houkai energy detected, "Object A" confirmed, mission starts.
250275	(O) Excuse me, who are you?　Are you related to those Mecha girls?
250276	(O) I'm autometa, amoured bunny driver Bronya.
250277	(O) Autometa?
250278	(O) Mei! Watch out!
250279	(O) Bang!
250280	(O) You attacked us at first, I need to give you a lesson!
250281	(O) Fighting mode… Turn on.
250282	(O) Kiana, don't hurt her!
250283	(O) It depends on her!
250284	(O) Finally, you stopped!?
250285	(O) Our attack works, let's save her now!
250286	(O) Battle ends, catch rate 24.36%, must lower than expectation, plan B, retreating…
250287	(O) Stop running!
250288	(O) …… What's wrong with that girl…
250289	(O) Kiana! All Mecha girls are leaving with her, there must be something worng!
250290	(O) Mei! Where are you going!?
250291	(O) I'm chasing her!
250292	(O) But… They are flying while we are walking… How can we chase her? Our aim should be escape from the Houkai area~
250293	(O) Alright……
250294	(O) Let's continue our plan~
250295	(O) Kiana, can you escape by yourself, you don't need to take this risk with me… Thank you for saving me.
250296	(O) Errr! Ahhhhh! Well! I know, I will go with you. Anyhow I find nothing until now, maybe I can find something I need in this thing……
250297	(O) Seriously?
250298	(O) Yes… Don't show me that face~ If we meet danger, we must leave immediately.
250299	(O) Yes, thank you…… Kiana.
250300	(O) Haha~ Relax! See, maybe we can use the railway there~
250301	(O) Humph.
250302	(O) Finally, we arrived. Thank god~
250303	Kiana-chan, it's funny ... is this really a station?  The smell of engine oil is terrible ...
250304	(O) Keep quiet, we need to check this place~
250305	(O) *Phone rings*
250306	(O) Turn off your phone first!
250307	(O) It's just an accident~ This phone is broken.
250308	(O) Let me see, Houkai energy detected… It's too much, how can it be~
250309	(O) Kiana! Look at this! Mecha girls, they are carrying something?
250310	(O) Ohhh! It's just like a box… It's so weird.
250311	(O) Kiana, can you remember after we get into the carriage, it moves, like it's waiting for us.
250312	(O) Do you mean it's a trip?
250313	(O) Yes.
250314	(O) There is no way here then, maybe they want to treat us~
250315	(O) Who?
250316	(O) But I think it's not a good thing, we'd better leave a way for ourselves~
250945	(O) Keep quiet~ Keep quiet~
250946	(O) Kiana.
250947	(O) Ah~ Don't scared me, Mei~
250948	(O) Do you know what are those Mecha girls carrying?
250949	(O) Humph…… I'm a little bit curious about it, those things should be carried from Houkai energy effected area. What should those things be?
250950	(O) Kiana, do you remember your phone was keep alarming?
250951	(O) I thought my phone was broken~
250952	(O) What if the alarm was real? Do you remember what happened on the rail? All Mecha girls are trying to protect it, if the thing is Houkai energy?
250953	(O) How is it possible?! How can they collect so much Houkai energy? … Wait, if they used Mecha girls to collect…
250954	(O) Humph… If they used machines to collect, it won't hurt people, but what are they doing with so much Houkai energy?
250955	(O) They carried energy to another place… It makes sense if those Mecha girls use Houkai energy as power.
250956	(O) Seriously? Is that possible?
250957	(O) It's not impossible, I know some organizations are doing experiments about this.
250958	(O) Errrr, does it mean the girl called "Bronya" was effected by Houkai energy too?
250959	(O) I didn't feel Houkai energy from her, she is fine~
250960	(O) Really…
250961	(O) Alright~ Mei, don't worry too much, we can figure it out next time when we see her.
250317	(O) Looks they park Mecha here…… Who can have such huge power to organize a party like this? It shouldn't be "Shicksal"……
250318	(O) I feel so bad… Is Bronya here too?
250319	(O) I feel it's possibly to meet her here. I don't want to see her again… Especially the "Armoured Bunny"…
250320	(O) I have a feeling during the battle, she was not fighting with her own will, she acts just like a rebot.
250321	(O) Maybe she is a rebot~ It's not impossible.
250322	(O) It's impossible! Human can't turn to machines, what a pity!
250323	(O) Alright~ Sorry! I'm just kidding! I think she is just a driver.
250324	(O) I still can't accept she became a fighting tool in such a young age……
250325	(O) Mei, stop thinking, we can talk to her after saving her~ Altough it would be tough~
250326	(O) If we can help her, it's also a redemption salvation for me…
250962	(O) Kiana, what's the "Shicksal" you just talked about?
250963	(O) Errrr!? Did I say that!
250964	(O) Yes… Why are you so nervous?
250965	(O) I was trying to think a way to explain it to you… You can think it's just as a evil organization.
250966	(O) Oh, bad guys?
250967	(O) No no no, it's just a example! I think you'd better don't know much about it.
250968	(O) Seems you are scared of them.
250969	(O) Absolutely, my dad told me although they are trying to beat Houkai, however, there are still a lot of bad news about them.
250970	(O) The reason for Houkai was not known by a lot people is… Shicksal is trying to block the information about it. They have great power over the world.
250971	(O) I think it's just like a story in novel.
250972	(O) They designed a series battle about Houkai energy! My dad and I was…
250973	(O) Errrr! I speak too much, we should find a way out…
250327	(O) Invader detected, "Object A" confirmed, abduction strategy succeeded.
250328	(O) Abduction strategy?
250329	(O) You don't have right to know the details.
250330	(O) …… I don't like you, kid!
250331	(O) Drop your weapons, I promise I won't hurt you.
250332	(O) No way!!
250333	(O) You can't break out of here! I suggest you not try this.
250334	(O) No, thanks~
250335	(O) Wait a second, Kiana. Bronya, I want to know the reason of attacking us, what's your aim?
250336	(O) I just obey orders.
250337	(O) I think you should do this, you are a kid, I want to know your thoughts!
250338	(O) Me? I'm just a part of this system, there is no "me".
250339	(O) No "me"?! This couldn't happen… Bronya, you are talking to me as a person!
250340	(O) I don't… Know… I need to executive command.
250341	(O) Invaild feedback… Caution…
250342	(O) Bronya? Where are you going!
250343	(O) Haha~ You are so cool, Mei, you beat her just with some words~
250344	(O) Stop it, Kiana! We must catch her!
250345	(O) Alright~
250346	(O) Bronya! Can you hear me?
250347	(O) I'm Bronya·Zaychik, the rate of I talk to you is 14.47%, I…
250348	(O) Hey, there is something wrong with that kid!
250349	(O) Personality resist level up to 4, loading…
250350	(O) Bronya!
250351	(O) Mei… Stop. She is a rebot now. We are talking to system now.
250352	(O) How it can be… Who did things like this!
250353	(O) Hide behind a little girl did things like this, I won't forgive that person!
250354	(O) Did we stop it successfully?
250355	(O) Forget about it, let's save Bronya first!
250356	(O) Let me see, there must some mechanisms……
250357	(O) Alert! Alert!
250358	(O) What's wrong with this? How can this rebot move by itself?
250359	(O) I did nothing so far… Maybe it's the firewall!
250360	(O) System start, retreating.
250361	(O) No! She wants to retreat again!
250362	(O) Kiana! All Mecha girls are activated now, we are surrounded by them!
250363	(O) No… At this time… We need to escape from here now!
250974	(O) Wow… It's so big, I don't even know where is the north… Sometimes, I really don't know what are those rich guys thinking…
250975	(O) ……
250976	(O) Ah! Mei, I'm not saying it to you~ Forget about it, haha~
250977	(O) No, I just missed my dad……
250978	(O) My dad made this great commercial empire, but it was…
250979	(O) Your father should be a great guy, it's weird he would knocked down by a commercial case…
250980	(O) Kiana, do you mean someone is trying to frame up my dad?
250981	(O) Errr! Calm down, Mei. It's just my guess.
250982	(O) Ah, I see…
250983	(O) Mei, have you ever thought about this before?
250984	(O) I… didn't think too much about it. Your words make sense……
250985	(O) Maybe your father find a way to escape at the very beginning, we just don't know it.
250986	(O) I hope so……
250987	(O) Alright~ Let's stop talking about this! Mei, maybe we can find clues about where is your dad!
250988	(O) Humph… Thank you, Kiana. Dad, he must be fine.
250989	(O) Yeah, that's my Mei~
250990	(O) Mei! Look this!
250991	(O) This is… The design drawing of those Mecha girls?
250992	(O) Oh, are those Mecha girls were all made from here? Collet Houkai energy and made Mecha girls, what do they want to do?
250993	(O) However, I didn't see any information about Bronya here.
250994	(O) That kid's mecha is different from others, her equipment is the best.
250995	(O) I think my father won't do things like this. He wouldn't let human become weapons!
250996	(O) My dad always told me he wished technology can improve human life.
250997	(O) Mei, do you still remember those special marks, there are some marks on the designer drawings too.
250998	(O) Yes, you're right!
250999	(O) I don't have any impression about this mark in Shicksal reports, which organization should it be?
251000	(O) Kiana, do you mean my bad was used by another organization which just like Shicksal?
251001	(O) Yes, it's possibly.
251002	(O) I must find out who is the murderer! I will do it for dad!
251003	(O) Humph, let's find our fathers together!
250364	(O) Finally we escape from that place. It's so nice to breath fresh air again~
250365	(O) This place is…
250366	(O) Mei?
250367	(O) Wow! I didn't expect it's such a huge bulding above that place!
250368	(O) This is ME Co., Ltd building.
250369	(O) Mei Co,. Ltd? Does it mean this place is your home!? You are so rich!
250370	(O) No! I'm not familiar with this place, I haven't entered this building before…
250371	(O) Honestly, I don't know much about my father, he was always work alone… I don't even know where is he now…
250372	(O) …Let's check this place, maybe we can find some clues about your father…
250373	(O) Kiana? Sorry… It's my private affairs, I'm fine, I can face to myself now.
250374	(O) I'm fine~
250375	(O) You are right, I can find the same mark on those Mecha girls, we followed that mark to ME Co., Ltd. There must be some relationships between them.
250376	(O) Bronya is here too!
250377	(O) This place is full of Mecha girls…
250378	(O) I think there must be a big secret behind ME Co., Ltd.
250379	(O) ?
250380	(O) My father knew every kinds of people, it's not so simple.
250381	(O) However, I can't remember those things so clear, I only have a little impression about this.
250382	(O) Mei, please tell me!
250383	(O) Long time ago, I was kidnapped by some criminals, I saw this mark.
250384	(O) Kidnap?! That's a huge news!
250385	(O) But… I can't remember that clearly, I know my father stay with me that time, I feel so happy that time.
250386	(O) So… Those Mecha girls are from the same criminal organization?!
250387	(O) I'm not sure… But there must be some relationships.
250388	(O) It's complicated now… I feel I got involved in a big case now.
250389	(O) Oh, wind. What's this place!?
250390	(O) Must be the parking apron on the roof, we are at the highest place now.
250391	(O) "Object A" arrived. Mission starts.
250392	(O) Oh, the kid is here, I won't let you go this time!
250393	(O) Kiana, clear the Mecha girls, make some space for me.
250394	(O) Ah! Do you have any strategies?
250395	(O) I will wake up her personality.
250396	(O) Fine~ Although I don't know what do you want to do, but I trust you~ I will watch your back!
250397	(O) Hey!
250398	(O) Errr……
250399	(O) Wow! You helped her out of that mecha! Good job!
250400	(O) Alert! Need assistance!
250401	(O) Bronya! Wake up! Your mind is controlled by Machinery! Now you are not the real you!
250402	(O) …Wake up? …
250403	(O) Personality detected, resist system level up…
250404	(O) Bronya! Touch my hands! Can you feel the temperature of my hands! You are not machine! Don't give up!
250405	(O) Temperature……
250406	(O) Yes! It means life!
250407	(O) Warning… Bronya…
250408	(O) Mei!
250409	(O) Bang!!!
250410	(O) Ah! What happened……
250411	(O) Seems there are still some loopholes in armoured bunny. It's not perfect.
250412	(O) You are not Bornya! Who are you?
250413	(O) My name is "C", I'm mom of Bronya, thank you for playing with my daughter, but game is over.
250414	(O) Raiden Mei, I will take you away.
250415	(O) I won't let you do that!
250416	(O) Ha, I still need to force you do this, then, sleep for a whole now!
250417	(O) Restarting…
250418	(O) Help her get out of this system while restarting.
250419	(O) Mei, help me hold her.
250420	(O) Alright. Hey! Why are you taking off her clothes?
250421	(O) I didn't see her connection part in last battle, it must on her body.
250422	(O) Ah… I feel so…
250423	(O) Must be this! Wait for a second~
250424	(O) Yes…
250425	(O) Kiana, have you finished it?
250426	(O) Alright, she is fine now~
250427	(O) Humph~ Bronya, how do you feel now?
250428	(O) I don't know how to answer you…
250429	(O) Nevermind~ I will protect you~ You don't need to use your body as weapons now~
250430	(O) Mei, I'm willing to obey your orders…
250431	(O) No, no one can order you in the future. Just be who you are.
250432	(O) Be who I am? "I"…
251302	(O) Humph, if the sign is right, we have arrived the edge area of Nagazora city.
251303	(O) Sign? Do you mean the ferris wheel?
251304	(O) Yes, that must be the Homuland, I heard this is the largest Homuland in this country~
251305	(O) ……
251306	(O) Now, we know the direction~
251307	(O) Mei, let's go~
251308	(O) ……
251309	(O) Bronya, what happened to you? Are you controlled by the "C" again?
251310	(O) Homu……
251311	(O) Homu, do you mean the Homuland?
251312	(O) ……
251313	(O) I want to check the Houkai energy there.
251314	(O) Wait a second, I didn't see any alert…
251315	(O) Don't follow us if you are scared.
251316	(O) You……!
251317	(O) Fine, don't be mad, Kiana. You can just treat it as a break since we have fought for a long time.
251318	(O) But…… That place is so famous so I guess we will meet a lot of zombies.
251319	(O) Alright, just zombies, you can beat them, can't you?
251320	(O) Kiana, look at Bronya's eyes, can you feel her desire? I think she must love that place and Homu very much…
251321	(O) And maybe we can help Bronya find herself at that place, I think we should go there~ Am I right, Bronya?
251322	(O) Yes, madam.
251323	(O) Although I can't change the appellation, but I think it's a nice start~
251324	(O) I still don't know is that place really fun as I heard.
251325	(O) Do you know Homu, Kiana? That's very famous!
251326	(O) Not much, I just have a little impression from comic book.
251327	(O) Homu is famous worldwide. A comic book called "Homu's adventure". Many readers love it very much!
251328	(O) Oh, you know a lot about this comic, Bronya~ And I'm thinking why do people love this little ugly monster?
251329	(O) Yes, I know a lot about it and stop be mean to Homu, otherwise I will do the same thing to you.
251330	(O) ……
251331	(O) Can you tell us some stories about Homu? I really want to know more about it~
251332	(O) Roger that!
251333	(O) Haha, stop talking like this~
251334	(O) Mei~ I see the merry-go-round, let's go to play it~
251335	(O) Oh? Do you like merry-go-round, Kiana?
251336	(O) No… No, I just want to play it with Mei~
251337	(O) How about Bronya, would you like to play it?
251338	(O) ……
251339	(O) Ah? She ran away……
251340	(O) Ha? She is going to turn on the merry-go-round!
251341	(O) She didn't talk too much about this place but I know she loves here.
251342	(O) But Mei, I think we should consider more about how to beat the next big wave of zombies……
251343	(O) I can handle that.
251344	(O) I won't let zombies hurt Homus here! Power up mode, activated!
251345	(O) Kiana, can you feel that there is something change on Bronya?
251346	(O) Humph? No, I still think she is just like a rebot.
251347	(O) Really? I think she changed a lot~
251348	(O) Although maybe she don't know how to represent herself, I can feel her love to Homu.
251349	(O) Ah, yes, if other people said bad thing about Homu, she would be mad…
251350	(O) If we can see her smile face someday, poor Bronya, maybe never she smiled before…
251351	(O) Relax, Mei~ She will turn to a "human" if she keep following us~
251352	(O) That's good~
251353	(O) That's what we just saw, the Homu ferris wheel?
251354	(O) Yes, that's also a famous tourist attraction, however, there are so many zombies.
251355	(O) Zombies here are become stronger and stronger, how about you, Mei?
251356	(O) I'm fine, however, I think I can't handle this too much time.
251357	(O) The famous tourist attraction in Nagazora city is Homu ferris wheel, the height is 300 meters, the speed is…
251358	(O) Bronya, how about you?
251359	(O) I'm introducing Homu ferris wheel.
251360	(O) Why are you doing this… We didn't say we want to go there.
251361	(O) Humph, I think Bronya is trying to represent her ideas. I think she is saying she likes there.
251362	(O) Do you want to go there, Bronya?
251363	(O) …… Yes!
251364	(O) Let's go to have a look of this ferris wheel~
251365	(O) I really don't think it's a good idea, shall we go back?
251366	(O) But we're halfway there~ And Bronya must want to go there.
251367	(O) I can see there are a lot of zombies in front of the gate.
251368	(O) It's so dangerous…
251369	(O) ……
251370	(O) Bronya looks so depressed…… Kiana, can we take Bronya to the ferris wheel?
251371	(O) But……
251372	(O) Relax, just some zombies, I will beat them~! Kiana, would you like to go ferris wheel with us?
251373	(O) With Mei… Hehe~
251374	(O) Kiana's heart rates increases 30%, I think Kiana has some bad thoughts.
251375	(O) No! How dare you say this, Bronya! Mei, let's go! I'm not afraid of zombies!
251376	(O) I don't tell lies.
251377	(O) I hear that we can see the whole Nagazora city, that's also a reason for this ferris wheel is so famous.
251378	(O) And there are some tales about this ferris wheel, for example, couples who play this won't break up!
251379	(O) Where did you get those, Kiana?
251380	(O) Bronya said those.
251381	(O) Oh? You listened so carefully~
251382	(O) I don't have special feelings… However, Bronya became more lively since we arrived Homuland……
251383	(O) *Hush*
251384	(O) Look Bronya~
251385	(O) Ah, she is sleeping.
251386	(O) Maybe she is too tired, we experienced so many wars~ And Bronya played a lot in Homuland.
251387	(O) Even I can't see the kid's smile, but I can feel her happiness~
251388	(O) Seele……
251389	(O) What was that……?
251390	(O) Seele, is that a girl's name? Maybe she is important to Bronya.
251391	(O) Seems Bronya has a lot of memories……
251392	(O) Yes, maybe she don't want to talk a lot about this.
251393	(O) Humph……
250433	Bronya, is your body alright?  Does it hurt anywhere?
250434	No physical abnormalities detected.  Don't worry about Bronya.
250435	(O) Relax, you can treat me as your sister~
250436	(O) Roger that.
250437	(O) Seems it's pretty hard to turn her to normal.
250438	(O) Nevermind, we have time to change her. I trust her.
250439	(O) Mei…
250440	(O) Bronya, everything will become better, let's escape from this Houkai first.
250441	(O) Humph…
250442	(O) Let's go then~
250443	(O) ……
250444	(O) Bronya, what happened?
250445	(O) Aircraft carrier detected.
250446	(O) Aircraft carrier? That's so exaggerated!
250447	(O) Kiana! Look!
250448	(O) That's H-U-G-E!
250449	(O) Here is Valkyrie team, you are safe now!
250450	(O) Great!~ They are helping us!
250451	(O) Mei! I knew that mark… It's "Shicksal"……
250452	(O) "Shicksal"… Fight mode… Turn on.
250453	(O) Hey! Don't do that!
250454	(O) "Anti-entropy". Prepare for battle!
250455	(O) Ahhh…
250456	(O) They thought we are from the "Anti-entropy". Poor me.
250457	(O) Don't worry, I said we are innocent. They will know.
250458	(O) Mei, they are not good people.
250459	(O) Sorry.
250460	(O) Nevermind, what's those two organizations?
250461	(O) Sorry, this is secret……
250462	(O) It must be related to ME Co., Ltd. We must find a way out.
250463	(O) Kiana, do you have any ideas?
250464	(O) Hoho~ Yes, they can't trapped in such a small place!
250465	(O) Stand back, Mei~ I'm preparing~
250466	(O) What…
250467	(O) Detonator, of course~
250468	(O) Bang!!!
250469	(O) *Cough* So quick…
250470	(O) The gate is too firm.
250471	(O) Can I have a try?
250472	(O) You!?
250473	(O) Armoured Bunny, destroy it.
250474	(O) Bang!!!
250475	(O) 「Alert! Alert! Explosion happened in N! Need assistance!」
250476	(O) Now… Everyone knows we are trying to escape!
250477	(O) Kiana, I think we'd better run now.
250478	(O) Kiana, let's go.
250479	(O) Fine~ It's obviously a better choice…
251004	(O) Bronya, your mecha is awesome, why do you never use it in battle?
251005	(O) Use Armored Bunny would make me overload, so it's the last option for me.
251006	(O) Bronya, Kiana and me will protect you.
251007	(O) …… I don't need that, if we meet battle, I should do the cover job.
251008	(O) No, I mean…
251009	(O) Well~ We don't need to figure it out so clearly, we can use behaviors to represent it.
251010	(O) Yes……
251011	(O) If Mei's aim is attack, I also can be the pioneer.
251012	(O) Ahhahaha… I think we may have some misunderstandings here.
251013	(O) Haha~ We are in a dangerous situation now, Bronya, please check if there is danger ahead.
251014	(O) Kiana, what are you saying!
251015	(O) Sorry, I just want to protect Mei. I don't care about Kiana.
251016	(O) What are you saying!
251017	(O) Ah… Can you be more friendly to each other?
250480	(O) Follow me, Mei!
250481	(O) It's just like a maze, can we find the exit way?
250482	(O) I'm checking now, please wait a second.
250483	(O) Why we found ME Mecha girls here! What's wrong with this place?!
250484	(O) I won't let you hurt Hyperion!
250485	(O) Errr. They find us!
250486	(O) I'm the leader of No.5 team, Himeko! You'd better drop your weapons now!
250487	(O) We are not members of "Anti-entropy"!
250488	(O) Humph, tell me truth!
250489	(O) Errr! She is so quick! We can't even touch her…
250490	(O) What happened? Anti-entropy is so weak!
250491	(O) Haven't you heard us… We are not from Anti-entropy, aunt!
250492	(O) Aunt……
250493	(O) Errr… What!?
250494	(O) Kiana, seems you said something horrible to her…
250495	(O) Hohoho… Anti-entropy kids, today is the day you die!
250496	(O) Danger detected.
250497	(O) Stop detecting, run is the only way for us now!
250498	(O) Ah… In order to avoid that aunt, we lost our way……
250499	(O) Exit detected, it's near the cage we were in.
250500	(O) What!?
250501	(O) Mecha girls are here because Armoured Bunny made a hole…
250502	(O) Errrr… That must be the reason for her madness.
250503	(O) Kiana… Don't judge others by their appearance. She has nice fight skills.
250504	(O) And the Valkyrie she just metioned is…
250505	(O) Valkyrie is a kind of battle team of Shicksal. They are used to Houkai energy, they can fight by using Houkai energy.
250506	(O) Use Houkai energy?
250507	(O) It's same as Armoured Bunny. It's powered by Houkai energy.
250508	(O) Awesome…
250509	(O) However, no one can controlled all Houkai energy, it's natural rule, we can't change it. All we can do is just stay alive.
250510	(O) Are we going back now?
250511	(O) I'm trying to find a better way to avoid battles.
250512	(O) Oh, no…
250513	(O) Kiana, do you have any resentments with Shicksal?
250514	(O) ……
250515	(O) My father and me are always avoiding arrests from Shicksal for years.
250516	(O) But, seems she doesn't know who I am, I think we can escape from here!
250517	(O) But you are trying to find your father? Maybe you can't find something related here.
250518	(O) Errr… I knew… However it's impossbile to let her tell us.
250519	(O) It's unacceptable.
250520	(O) Haha~ Don't worry about me! I believe I can find my father, I'm used to stay alone.
250521	(O) Maybe we can find information in the data base of Shicksal.
250522	(O) Seriously!
250523	(O) But we need to find the port first… Such as control system.
250524	(O) Errr! Do you mean you want to hack their system?
250525	(O) If you can do that… It's fine, but we should think about "How to escape from here" first.
250526	(O) ……
250527	(O) Kiana! It's a chance!
250528	(O) But… Ot's too dangerous, we'd better escape first.
250529	(O) Kiana…
251018	(O) This Hyperion is so large, I can't image we already have enough technology to make such an aircraft carrier……
251019	(O) This aircraft carrier is just a paper tiger, compare to Anti-entropy's technology, it's not a big deal.
251020	(O) Competition is everywhere in those two organizations…
251021	(O) Why are they in the opposite position? They have the same aim-against Houkai, why do they can't make an agreement?
251022	(O) Maybe they have different faith, even the Houkai destroyed human's home, they still can't hurt each other.
251023	(O) Sorry, I can't understand our organization, I just obey orders.
251024	(O) Ahhh… I don't mean to blame Bronya, I'm just curious about it.
251025	(O) The situation is clearly now, they are both our enemies~
251026	(O) I will protect Mei even if I need to fight with Anti-entropy.
251027	(O) You are reliable~ But I need to say this first: I'm not totally trust you, if you dare to betry us, I will beat you!
251028	(O) Sure, I don't think I lose in the last fight with you, I can beat you if there was only you.
251029	(O) You…
251030	(O) Alright~ Alright~ We are still in enemies' siege, we'd better find a way out now~
250530	(O) It's not far away from the exit.
250531	(O) …… Humph, we can escape when those Mecha girls destroying~ No one would notice us~
250532	(O) Kiana, is that really fine?
250533	(O) Mei, don't worry about me! Let's go first!
250534	(O) Humph, rabbits, where are you going now?
250535	(O) Errr!? You said you destroy their monitoring system, Bronya…
250536	(O) Haha, it's my house, I know everything here!
250537	(O) We are not far away from the exit, I will beat you!
250538	(O) Okay, try it!
250539	(O) Get out of my way!
250540	(O) ……
250541	(O) Bronya! Chance!
250542	(O) Armoured Bunny, fire!
250543	(O) Bang!!!!
250544	(O) I won't let you do it! Hyperion, take off now!
250545	(O) Boom!
250546	(O) No time to waste! Let's go before it taking off, Mei!
250547	(O) No way!!
250548	(O) Ah!!
250549	(O) Mei!
250550	(O) Kiana, leave me! Get out of here!
250551	(O) Errr… Let her go!
250552	(O) No wonder Anti-entropy treats partner so good, what? Hyperion is taking off now~
250553	(O) You!
250554	(O) Kiana, watch out!
250555	(O) What do you…!
250556	(O) Bang!
250557	(O) Wow! This power!?
250558	(O) I catch Mei, Kiana, follow me.
250559	(O) Ok!
250560	(O) Bang!!
250561	(O) She broke the Hyperion… Catch them!
250562	(O) Ouch1! This place is……
250563	(O) Ground floor of Hyperion. It just like a garden.
250564	(O) Garden? In an aircraft carrier? That's weird.
250565	(O) Errr! Forget about it first! How is Mei!
250566	(O) I'm fine.
250567	(O) Great!
250568	(O) But what should we do now, we are flying now, it's impossible to jump…
250569	(O) I have two ideas, one is find the escape compartment, the other is trying to take control of this aircraft carrier.
250570	(O) You… Are full of dangerous ideas.
250571	(O) We can get information about Kiana's father if we can take control of this place.
250572	(O) Yes.
250573	(O) Kiana! Let's go!
250574	(O) Mei… Fine, let's have a try.
250575	(O) Got it, fire, Armoured Bunny.
250576	(O) Bang!!!
250577	(O) Errr! What are you doing!?
250578	(O) I need to attract some enemies.
250579	(O) ……
250580	(O) Bang!!!
250581	(O) It's messed up!
251031	(O) ……
251032	(O) Kiana, what happened? Unexpectedly you have bad mood too.
251033	(O) No, I was just thinking what if I can't find clues about my father here…
251034	(O) Kiana…
251035	(O) I lived with my father since I was a child, he always told me this world is dangerous, I must be stonger to overcome difficulties by myself.
251036	(O) I never give up even my father left me. I think it's a trial my father gave me. I will find him!
251037	(O) Kiana, I think your father is protecting you somewhere~
251038	(O) I think so, however, he disappeared for a long time…
251039	(O) If I can't find any information in the organization-Shicksal which he worked for… I really don't know who to find him…
251040	(O) What's the relationship between your father and Shicksal? Why you are always trying to avoid them?
251041	(O) Errr……
251042	(O) Ah~ Sorry, you don't need to answer me.
251043	(O) I think… maybe my dad touched too many people's ass so he is being haunted. Maybe my dad has some stories with the aunt named "Himeko"…
251044	(O) Ah!?
251045	(O) Hahaha… Your father is so funny.
251046	(O) Actually, I still can't image why my father was haunted by others…
251047	(O) Ok, let's change a topic. We'd better find the control room first, we still have chances!
251048	(O) Yes!
250582	(O) I was keep thinking the function of this garden?
250583	(O) Maybe it's the place for rest.
250584	(O) This is a purify system.
250585	(O) So… Maybe we can find normal people here.
250586	(O) Houkai is harmful to normal people…
250587	(O) It's not time to think about this kind of questions. We'd better consider more about ourselves~
250588	(O) Bronya, when can we arrive there?
250589	(O) Before we enter the bridge, there is one more thing need to do.
250590	(O) Armoured Bunny, special mode, turn on.
250591	(O) What do you want to do this time?!
250592	(O) Made a new route, it's much easier to arrive bridge by using this.
250593	(O) Alright… You are so dangerous.
250594	(O) I found them! Catch them!
250595	(O) Errrr… They found us! We'd better retreat now!
250596	(O) Hoho… We are safe now.
250597	(O) Emmm… Although it's a little bit far from the bridge, we have no choice.
250598	(O) *Noise current*
250599	(O) How about it? Bronya, can you do this?
250600	(O) This is… Why there is such a thing in aircraft carrier?
250601	(O) What happened to Bronya?
250602	(O) Sorry, I failed, this aircraft carrier was modified, there is something special here.
250603	(O) Let me see, what's this? A sword?
250604	(O) Fusion system, the most powerful weapon of Hyperion.
250605	(O) What time!?
250606	(O) Die!
250607	(O) Armoured bunny, fire!
250608	(O) Bang!!
250609	(O) How can you hit me!
250610	(O) Sorry, you're not my aim.
250611	(O) Bang!!!
250612	(O) Errr, the roof!?
250613	(O) Mei, let's go, we have no other ways.
250614	(O) Sorry for breaking your things. Very sorry!
250615	(O) Hey!! It's a huge hole, she must be very angry……
250616	(O) What should we do now, just rush to the bridge?
250617	(O) This is best way now.
250618	(O) You call this best?!
250619	(O) Kiana! Keep moving, we have no other choice.
250620	(O) Alright, let's go.
250621	(O) It's so hard… Mecha girls, Valkyries…
250622	(O) Bronya! Are those Mecha girls your allies? Can you ask them stop firing!?
250623	(O) Sorry, they can't detect my mark now, I'm their enemies now.
250624	(O) So, it's your fault, Kiana~
250625	(O) Noooo~
250626	(O) 「Alert! Alert! Invaders detected!」
250627	(O) Must we do this in such a aboveboard way?
250628	(O) There is a way to weak our enemies, that is break the garden, the Houkai energy would  afftect some people.
250629	(O) Absolutely not! We can't do this!
250630	(O) I can't understand you, we should use all ways to win.
250631	(O) Bronya, we are human, not machines, there is something we can't do as a human being.
250632	(O) …… I got it, I need to think about this.
251049	(O) Shicksal's aircraft carrier has found something weird, it maybe…
251050	(O) Bronya, what are you doing there, follow us!
251051	(O) I was just thinking what was the thing.
251052	(O) Do you mean the sword, yes, it's too huge, I don't know who can use it…
251053	(O) I remember I have seen a smiliar one from animation, it's called……
251054	(O) Ah~ I didn't expect you have knowledge about animation.
251055	(O) Errrr! No! I only watch them when I'm too lonely…
251056	(O) Alright~ I get it.
251057	(O) Look at that blade, we can know it's not made for aircraft carrier, I think we can get more information after we check it more closer.
251058	(O) Hey? Are you kidding me! Do you know where is us now?
251059	(O) Humph, I just said I have that plan, but I didn't try to make it real, relax, Kiana!
251060	(O) Well~
251061	(O) Ah! The name should be "Zanjintou"!
251062	(O) Errrr… You were still thinking about that thing.
250633	(O) This is the bridge.
250634	(O) Finally…
250635	(O) Humph! How dare you attack me in such a aboveboard way?
250636	(O) So many enemies.
250637	(O) Hyperion is powerful, it's not so easy to beat us.
250638	(O) Trust me, there must be some misunderstandings, we are not from Anti-entropy!
250639	(O) I don't want to hear those things, I don't believe it.
250640	(O) We are just want to leave here, aunt!
250641	(O) I have checked your background, rich girl Raiden Mei for ME Co., Ltd, little kid the Anti-entropy weapon and twhite hair girl.
250642	(O) Although I haven't found information about the white hair girl… But your movement told me you are not good person.
250643	(O) Do you mean there is some relationships between ME Co., Ltd and Anti-entropy? Do you have any information about my father? What happened to her?
250644	(O) You don't need to know this.
250645	(O) Humph, I think we should give her a lesson, let's go, Mei!
250646	(O) You can't beat me!
250647	(O) Fusion system, prepare for battle with Mecha girls after I beat those kids.
250648	(O) Fusion system, what's …
250649	(O) Bang!!!
250650	(O) What's this sound!?
250651	(O) Although I want to show you the real power of Hyperion, but you will end here.
250652	(O) The floor opens, does the system start?
250653	(O) High energy detected, this is nuclear power system…
250654	(O) Nuclear power? What's that!
250655	(O) Ahh… I lost to those kids.
250656	(O) Is the fusion armour prepared? Although it's a little bit waste to use it, but in order to finish those in a short time.
250657	(O) Finish? Are you trying to catch Herrscher too!?
250658	(O) Herrscher? The information is real! St.Freya HS, here is Hyperion, we need help!
250659	(O) Beep beep.
250660	(O) This is from the… St.Freya HS?
250661	(O) Himeko, you opened the fusion system, what happened?
250662	(O) Master Theresa, there are some invaders in Hyperion, we are fight with them now.
250663	(O) Anti-entropy?
250664	(O) So I said I'm not from Anti-entropy! I am…
250665	(O) Kiana… Are you Kiana·Kaslana!?
250666	(O) Errr… Yes, how do you know my name? Are you my father's enemy?
250667	(O) Siegfried… He said bad things about me again!
250668	(O) This kid? You called her "Master"?!
250669	(O) I can hear you, kids!
250670	(O) Himeko, they are not members of Anti-entropy, I can prove it. However, they are not normal kids, please protect them.
250671	(O) …… Roger that.
250672	(O) Wait a second! How do you know my father! Do you have any information about him? Can you tell me where is he?
250673	(O) Oh, slow down. You have same characters just as your father, if you want ot know this, just follow Himeko.
250674	(O) I'm waiting for you in St.Freya HS.
250675	(O) St.Freya HS?
250676	(O) Seems we have no other choice, but we finally escape from the Houkai area……
55868	(O) Kiana is taking training in St. Freya HS. At the same time, Bronya got controlled by Anti-entropy abd help Anti-entropy to attack St. Freya HS.
55869	(O) Theresa and Himeko lead No.5 team to the Hyperion, prepare for battle!
55870	(O) We wwill take off in 15 minutes.
55871	(O) Hurry up! It's time to show them our power!
55872	(O) Bang!!
55873	(O) Errr! What happened?
55874	(O) Anti-entropy Mecha soldiers are attacking us! Some of them have invaded in Hyperion, valkyries are fighting with them.
55875	(O) Annoying…
55876	(O) I want to beat them…
55877	(O) …
55878	(O) Theresa, I'd like to do it with Bronya! I will prove Bronya is not a bad person!
55879	(O) Mei, I will go with you!
55880	(O) Al…Alright… I will give you 10 minutes. Otherwise, I will give you "D" as grade!
55881	(O) QAQ, that's tough, as your commander, I will help you~
55882	(O) Hoho~ Take it easy! We can handle this. Compare to master's concrete cross, it's a piece of cake.
55883	(O) Hey! It's Judah's oath, not "concrete cross"!
55884	(O) Yeah~ Let's go!
55885	(O) Main path, clear!
55886	(O) Good job, we will take off in 6 minutes 14 seconds.
55887	(O) Got it.
55888	(O) Haha~ So we finished very well this time!
55889	(O) I will give you "A" this time.
55890	(O) Humph~ This is just a piece of cake to us!
55891	(O) Bronya did great job too! They lost the control of her.
55892	(O) Humm, yes…
55893	(O) Maybe the chip in her mind was broken when she fight with master…
55894	(O) Was she hit by the "concrete cross"? You must be kidding me!
55895	(O) Stop chatting at this moment! Go back to the main bridge! Will are taking off now!
55896	(O) The following battle will be more tougher, let's take a break now.
55897	(O) Alright, let's go, Bronya~
55898	(O) ? Where is Bronya?
55899	(O) What!?
55900	(O) 「Here is nuclear power unit! We got threatened! She is a… Valkyrie! Ahhhh!」
55901	(O) 「Warning! Warning! Nuclear power unit is being attacked!」
55902	(O) How…
55903	(O) It's Bronya!! We must stop her!
55904	(O) Is she trying to perish together?
55905	(O) Armored Bunny… Target… Nuclear power unit.
55906	(O) Bronya!
55907	(O) Enemy target, enter… "Destroy Mode".
55908	(O) Why… Bronya! Wake up!
55909	(O) We don't have so much time to wake up her, we must stun her.
55910	(O) I will handle this! You'd better give up!
55911	(O) Humph, I have destroyed your mecha gun~ You'd better surrender.
55912	(O) ……
55913	(O) Life protect system off… Armored Bunny will destoryed after 30 seconds.
55914	(O) Stop her! She is trying to use Armored Bunny to dynamite the nuclear power unit!
55915	(O) Hey! Bronya, are you crazy?
55916	(O) We can only…
55917	(O) No!
55918	(O) Mei,get out of the way! We don't have time now! Do you want to die here with her?
55919	(O) Bronya… Please, wake up!
55920	(O) Destroy after 15 seconds.
55921	(O) Do you remember the pudding we eaten together…
55922	(O) Destroy after 10 seconds.
55923	(O) Do you remember the Homu park…
55924	(O) …8 seconds.
55925	(O) We have found a spring together!
55926	(O) Look, tears on Bronya's face, is she crying?
55927	(O) …6 seconds
55928	(O) The dinner we had together!
55929	(O) …4 seconds.
55930	(O) We took training together! Had class together! Slept together! We had a great time…
55931	(O) …2 seconds.
55932	(O) Please!!!!!
55933	(O) S…T…O…P
55934	(O) It's now!!
55935	(O) Dong!!!!
55936	(O) Errrr……
55937	(O) Kiana, you?
55938	(O) It's the best time to stun her! We need to avoid the risk of her lost control again.
55939	(O) Humm, we are safe now…
55940	(O) Humph…
55941	(O) Bronya!
55942	(O) Mei sama, where are we?
55943	(O) Here is main bridge.
55944	(O) Was I just lost control again?
55945	(O) Bronya, you'd better leave here…
55946	(O) I got it…
55947	(O) Master! Please wait!
55948	(O) I trust Bronya. I just did a check to her head.
55949	(O) She got control herself and Kiana broke her chip.
55950	(O) So…
55951	(O) Don't make the conclusion too early, we need to do a further check to Bronya.
55952	(O) Yes, totally understand.
55953	(O) Alright~ Let's beat Anti-entropy first! Bronya will recover soon~
55954	(O) Sorry… Mei, Bronya made you worry again…
55955	(O) Hahaha~Bronya! You can't even finished my request!
55956	(O) Report! Anti-entropy has hacked our communication system!
55957	(O) Sin…
55958	(O) Hohoho…Nevermind, Bronya can't do it but I can! I will destroy Shicksal.
55959	(O) Mom will be proud of me! Hahaha!!
55960	(O) Bang!!
55961	(O) Left bridge is being attacked! There are invaders!
55962	(O) Hohoho~ Let's start a hunting game~
55963	(O) 「Warning!Warning!No.1, No.2 nuclear power units has closed!We have to land soon!」
55964	(O) Start the No.3 and No.4 nuclear power units! We must protect there!
55965	(O) Ahhh~ They have spared ones… Nevermind, I will destroy there too!
55966	(O) Bronya, your friend is a strange kid…
55967	(O) Sin, stop it! I don't want to fight with you.
55968	(O) Hoho~ You betrayed us, mom said you were important, now you're useless.
55969	(O) Nevermind, I will help mom make her dream real!
55970	(O) Die!!
55971	(O) Ping!
55972	(O) Ahahahaha!!! You can't beat me!
55973	(O) Errr…… Ahhh, you are so annoying!
55974	(O) Humph~ Do you think you can beat us by yourself? Don't look down upon me~
55975	(O) Bronya! Are you alright?
55976	(O) I'm fine.
55977	(O) Why… You always have so many friends around? You are nothing!
55978	(O) Sin, power is not only thing…
55979	(O) Hehehe…Hahaha!!! Are you kidding me? That's funny!!
55980	(O) Ahhh… Nevermind, I'm not interested now… I will kill you!
55981	(O) 「Sin,enough. Retreat now，you can't win them now!」
55982	(O) Mom!? No!! Trust me ,please! I will beat them all…
55983	(O) 「This is order.」
55984	(O) Cooo…errrrr!!! We shall see!!
55985	(O) I won't let you go!
55986	(O) Kiana, stop chasing! We need to clear other enemies now!
55987	(O) Humm…
55988	(O) Nuclear power units are in bad situation, we can't fly like this safely.
55989	(O) Bang!!
55990	(O) Wow!! Are we chasing by them? We need to fight back!!
55991	(O) Next wave is coming!
55992	(O) Bang!!
55993	(O) Errr! I can't let Hyperion shot by them as a target…
55994	(O) If we can use Nexus system, it would be differernt…
55995	(O) I'm so angry!!!
55996	(O) …
55997	(O) Errr... Bronya, do you have any idea?
55998	(O) If we can arrive "Moonlight throne", maybe I can stop it.
55999	(O) Really?
56000	(O) I saw the design drawing of anti-tropy's battleship, we can destroy its power system in "Moonlight throne".
56001	(O) Pay them back in their own coin… I can do that~
56002	(O) Go, Hyperion!
56003	(O) Hey! Calm down!
56004	(O) Don't worry! I will handle this~ Just knock-out a hole~
56005	(O) No! Are you drunk now?
56006	(O) No.5 team, get ready.
56007	(O) Wow!!!
56008	(O) Bang!!
56009	(O) That's awesome!
56010	(O) Is here "Moonlight throne"…
56011	(O) No.5 team!
56012	(O) Roger that! We have arrived "Moonlight throne".
56013	(O) We will create some space for you.
56014	(O) Enemies are coming, prepare for battle.
56015	(O) Let's do it!
56016	(O) It's order from Theresa!
56017	(O) Take care of yourself!
56018	(O) *Sound of firing*
56019	(O) Bang!!
56020	(O) Cough! Too many enemies!
56021	(O) Because we are in their place now…
56022	(O) If we can reach the power unit, I can try to stop them.
56023	(O) We will help you!
56024	(O) Let's go.
56025	(O) Roger that!
56026	(O) Hohoho, guess who are coming? I won't let you do that.
56027	(O) Sin…
56028	(O) I don't want to harm you or Seele, we know each other for many years…
56029	(O) Hahaha! Good joke!
56030	(O) Don't you remember what mom said? Only the strongest person can alive!
56031	(O) Sin, enough, it's over now.
56032	(O) Why!Why! Why I can't win you once! You are so weak!
56033	(O) I was like you. Power is not the only thing we should have.
56034	(O) However, I have new targets now, I love my friends.
56035	(O) We are human, not weapon!
56036	(O) I want to have smile just like others!
56037	(O) Shut up! Shut up! I must kill you all!
56038	(O) Sorry, Sin…
56039	(O) Leave me alone! Don't show mery on me!
56040	(O) Sorry,I should save you earlier…
56041	(O) Don't like at me like that! Don't! No!
56042	(O) Ahhhhh!!!!
56043	(O) Watch out!!
56044	(O) Bang!!
56045	(O) Err…
56046	(O) Sin…
56047	(O) What happen to her? Is she got controlled like Bronya was?
56048	(O) Stop it, mother!
56049	(O) Bronya, seems you don't remember our aim anymore… It's time to break with the past. I'm waiting for you.
56050	(O) Is here "Power unit"? …「Sirin」? What's that?
56051	(O) Hummm…
56052	(O) Kiana? What happened?
56053	(O) Don't worry! Just a little bit tired.
56054	(O) Finally, you arrived here.
56055	(O) You should feel proud to stand here.
56056	(O) Mother…
56057	(O) Don't call me "mother", I'm your enemy now.
56058	(O) You… What's you target?
56059	(O) You will lose your lives here. Poor girls.
56060	(O) What do you mean? We are fighting for all human beings.
56061	(O) Fight for human being? How cute you are! You are making the Houkai power stronger!
56062	(O) What do you mean?
56063	(O) You can't clear the Houkai power, all you did just made it greater!
56064	(O) Of course, Houkai power is envolving with human technology development. We can't avoid the destroy of human.
56065	(O) So… Anti-entropy's aim is "destroy all things", right?
56066	(O) Don't be impatient! We are human too, we are also trying to find a way to save all people.
56067	(O) Our conclusion is we should make all Houkai power release.
56068	(O) You must be crazy! If you do that, all people must die.I won't let you do that!
56069	(O) How impulsive you are!
56070	(O) Humm…
56071	(O) Kiana, are you alright?
56072	(O) I'm fine, don't worry~
56073	(O) Bad girls, you should just sit there are watch the new centry coming!
56074	(O) That's nonsense! We won't let that happen… Death won't make the new era! We will save all human beings!
56075	(O) You still don't understand. Shicksal seal more Houkai power, the more serious consequence it will be. You will be the murderers.
56076	(O) What…
56077	(O) We can protect part of human beings now, so we choose to activate all Houkai power now. We will die, but some people will survive.
56078	(O) Bronya, you will stay alive. You will create the great new world!
56079	(O) …
56080	(O) Bronya, come back~ We will go to the brand new world.
56081	(O) Sorry, mother… I choose to fight with Mei sama.
56082	(O) Seriously? Bronya, you are a big girl now. It's your choice, I won't stop you. I will do the last thing to you then.
56083	(O) I will kill you by myself.
56084	(O) Power unit is infront of us. I won't let you destroy the St. Freya Hs.
56085	(O) Humph! You still haven't understood us. We're not interested in your trial. Shicksal will be judged by the new human.
56086	(O) However, I need to activate Houkai power by wake up one thing in St. Freya HS.
56087	(O) One thing? Did you try to control Bronya to find that in church?
56088	(O) Yes, it should be ours.I just try to get it back today!
56089	(O) What's… that?
56090	(O) Seems Theresa still has some secrets to you. Hoho~
56091	(O) It's the product of the "Second Houkai power rampage" 2000 years ago-- "The second Herrscher".
56092	(O) "The second Herrscher"……
56093	(O) You seems don't remember your identity, Mei. She was same as you, the difference is you are "alive".
56094	(O) I have read that in a book. 2000 years ago, Shicksal valkyries killed "The second Herrscher" in Siberia.
56095	(O) It should be "caught" not "killed".
56096	(O) I don't care! What's your aim to get it?
56097	(O) Humph, I thought you were just followed Shicksal orders. I'm wrong, You were just controlled by Shicksal and knew nothing.
56098	(O) What are you saying?
56099	(O) We haven't changed our aim, we will activate Houkai power, start the new era. We still need two things, one is "The second Herrscher" and the other, guess what it is?
56100	(O) The other thing…
56101	(O) …
56102	(O) Errr!!
56103	(O) Mei!?
56104	(O) Bingo, "The third Herrscher" Raiden Mei!
56105	(O) Leave her alone!!
56106	(O) …
56107	(O) Ping!!!
56108	(O) Er ahhhh!!!
56109	(O) Hehehe… Sin, show me your power!
56110	(O) Yes, mom.
56111	(O) Nooo!!! I won't let you harm Mei!!
56112	(O) Sorry… Mom, I'm too weak, can't even stay alive…
56113	(O) Sin, nevermind. I will take you to the brand new world.
56114	(O) Oh, cradlesong, I feel so warm…
56115	(O) Take a sleep, when you wake up, it will be the brand new world.
56116	(O) Yes, mom…
56117	(O) ……
56118	(O) *Sound of cough*
56119	(O) Kiana!
56120	(O) It's all over, I said it. I won't let you detroy the things I love…
56121	(O) Humph, naive. It's your fate.
56122	(O) 「Sirin」 is not only a "Power unit", it's also the "key" to open the new world! It's the core of "The second Herrscher".
56123	(O) Core of "The second Herrscher"?
56124	(O) It our destiny.
56125	(O) I can change it!
56126	(O) Really? Just show me then…
56127	(O) Sirin, wake up. My daughter, finish the last part to start the new era!
56128	(O) 「Yes,my mom」
56129	(O) Bang!!!
56130	(O) Errr!! What happened…
56131	(O) Houkai power detected. "Moonlight throne" is falling!
56132	(O) Brand new world…
56133	(O) Welcome back, Houkai power and "The second Herrscher"! Hahahaha!
250677	(O) 「Alert！Alert！Moonlight throne is falling, Alert！Alert！」
250678	(O) Team 5! Can you hear me!? Anti-entropy's warship is falling! Leave there!
250679	<i>Cough!</i> Cocolia, do you really want us to die with you?!
250680	Death... Death is simply the beginning of eternal life.  When God's messenger descends, all sins will be forgiven.  Only when you've chosen death will your soul be freed!//n(TN: CN says heart, JP says mind, I'm going to guess they meant it metaphorically)
250681	Man reveres God and believes in God, who destroys himself, as his Messiah. Death is the final salvation God gives to mankind. All you've lost will be regained!
250682	Who would accept such a negative ending!  People are valuable because they are alive.  No one has the right to take another person's life!
250683	Ha, it's no use what a stupid little girl like you does now. The Scale of Providence leaned toward Anti-Entropy.  It's time for all of humanity to be freed!//n(TN: Insert komm susser tod here)
250684	Is that so? Then I'll teach "god" a lesson!
250685	(O) Kiana! Where are you going?!
250686	(O) I must close the smelter… Cough! Although I don't know what's going on! However, the smelter must be the "Key" for resurgence the "Herrscher"…
250687	Kiana, stop messing around! The current situation is not easy to overcome. Follow my orders and escape from the battleship!
250688	(O) Sorry… Master Theresa! I can't leave there myself, please take Mei and Bronya away!
250689	(O) No! Stop saying like that! I promised Cecilia I will protect you! If…
250690	(O) Kiana… You…
250691	(O) I decided it… Cough! Sorry, leave here, Mei.
250692	(O) You won't succeed! Moonlight throne! Attack! No one can leave here tonight!
250693	(O) Bang!!!!
250694	(O) Errrr…
250695	(O) Bronya!?
250696	Don't worry about Bronya... I don't want to see my mom suffer anymore.  Kiana, I'll watch your back.  Let's end this!
250697	That's right... Kiana! I won't let you fight alone! Let's stop this catastrophe together!
250698	(O) Mei… Hoho~ I love you so much~
250699	(O) Let's turn off the machine!
250700	(O) Yeah!
250701	(O) Kiana! Kiana! Answer me! She cut down the communication…
250702	(O) Master… We lost the Moonlight throne signal, from the report of ground troops… It was destroyed after hitting the Big Church…
250703	(O) ……
250704	(O) No!! No!! Why they didn't follow my orders! It's so difficult… So difficuly for me to see you again… Why…
250705	(O) They are kids, but we can do nothing for them! I'm too useless!
250706	Headmistress...
250707	(O) Beep Beep.
250708	(O) Big Church… Houkai energy? This couldn't happen…
250709	(O) Master Theresa! Houkai energy detected at where Moonlight throne crashed! It's still increasing!
250710	(O) … The long sleep devil finally will awake, we chose wrongly at the very beginning time, it's time to pay it.
250711	(O) Master, what do you mean…?
250712	(O) Hyperion landing! Shicksal, get ready for battle… St. Freya HS will fight until the last time, this is our last redemption, please show mercy, gods!
250713	(O) …… Roger that.
250714	(O) Is this the wreckage of Moonlight throne?
250715	(O) Master Theresa! Enemies on the ground were cleared! Where is Bronya!? Is she alright……
250716	(O) They are in the Moonlight throne, they were falling with the warship…
250717	(O) … This… Bronya!
250718	(O) There are still some weapons in wreckage, maybe they are still alive?!
250719	(O) … You are right! Follow me, let's find them!
250720	(O) Roger that!
250721	(O) Ka!!
250722	(O) Is that enemy!? Ready for battle!
250723	(O) Wait! That's Remodeled Bunny 19C!
250724	(O) Cough!
250725	(O) Mei… Are you alright?
250726	(O) Humph… I'm fine, Bronya protected me… Kiana! Where is she?
250727	(O) Kiana… She ran to the smelter and didn't come back, I just saw Mei fell from the smelter.
250728	Kiana… Why! She pushed me out at the last moment… Why did she this! We promised to face it together!
250729	(O) ……
250730	(O) Master Theresa… I'm… sorry… It's… all my fault…
250731	No, it's not your fault... If I were in Kiana's position, I'm sure I would have done the same. She's such a stupid child...
250732	(O) Himeko, keep searching… We must find her!
250733	(O) Humph… Let me help too… She must be alive… At least, let me see her again…
250734	Headmistress Theresa, directly ahead is the center of where the Honkai energy is pouring out.
250735	(O) Dogma district… I see… Prepare for battle, Valkyries! This maybe our last battle…
250736	(O) Master… What's inside…
250737	(O) Cocolia said the second "Herrscher" is buried under the Big Church, is that true?
250738	(O) …… Although it's secret, however, there is no need to hide it.
250739	(O) Yes, the second "Herrscher" is here…
250740	(O) So, the resurgence is true too?!
250741	(O) I'm not sure now, because no one did it before, our experiment failed too… We are still learning it. It's just a dream to revive her.
250742	You mean Shicksal also attempted to revive a Herrscher?
250743	(O) What!? Revive "Herrscher"! Why Shicksal tried to do this thing?! Our destiny should be destroy them, right?!
250744	(O) We are trying to know more thing s about the Houkai energy, so we can find the way to beat Houkai monsters. Human beings also can have the hope of reborn.
250745	(O) Hope of reborn? Valkyries should be the hope! Why we need to based on "Herrscher"?! They are trying to detroy human beings!
250746	Major Himeko ... If I hadn't studied the Herrscher, there wouldn't be the current St. Freyja Academy.
250747	(O) So the Valkyries are…
250748	(O) Not all people can be Valkyries, only the members of three big families and few other people are qualified. Valkyries should be used to the Houkai energy, we learned a lot from the second "Herrscher".
250749	(O) That's why St. Freya HS is the base of Valkyries and can training Valkyries.
250750	(O) That's what I think…
250751	But you made enough progress by studying the Herrscher, right?  So why did you try to revive one?
250752	The reason is simple... To counter the next Herrscher.  The next Herrscher is- That is, you, Raiden Mei... and the fourth and fifth Herrschers who will be born in the future.
250753	(O) Houkai energy never ends, we have paid too much to stop it. We must find a way to against Houkai energy.
250754	And --- the most powerful force against a Herrscher is another Herrscher.
250755	(O) Cough! More and more Houkai energy here… It's even more than in Nagazora…
250756	(O) Normal Valkyries can't take so much Houkai energy in the front, Himeko, take others to safe place.
250757	(O) No! At least let me stay with you! It's my only wish! And… Kiana is my student, I have the duty to take her out!
250758	(O) Humph… Fine.
250759	(O) Are we going to have a battle with the second "Herrscher"? Does Anti-entropy really have that power…
250760	(O) Actually, Shicksai have the power to do this, however, a key material belongs to Anti- entropy.
250761	(O) The core of "Herrscher"…
250762	(O) Yes. After the second Houkai explosion, Shicksai is very weak, there was a mysterious organization asked us to give them the "Herrscher's" body, that's Anti-entropy.
250763	(O) It's all because their leader at that time, the leader named "Walter".
250764	(O) Walter is the founder of Anti-entropy, I have never seen her before, she is just like imaginary.
250765	(O) But at that time, she is the first "Herrscher", she showed her power to Shicksai… We don't have power to against her that time… We approved their need, but we didn't do it all.
250766	(O) Although we gave the most important part to them, but we kept the rest part, we hide it in the Dogma district. Anti-entropy's aim today is find it.
250767	(O) Seriously? This revive thing really could happen?
250768	(O) This is just a report, I wish it won't be the result.
250769	(O) Hurry up! Dogma district is just ahead, I can feel the danger.
250770	(O) Mom… Where are you…
250771	(O) Errr… This voice is? I remember I rush forward to the smelter, and then…
250772	(O) Mom… Is that you? Are you coming to take me…
250773	(O) No… I'm not your mom… My name is Kiana.
250774	(O) You are not… mom… But you have the same smell as mom, the smell of sun…
250775	(O) Haha~ Thanks~ Who are you? Can you tell me where is this place?
250776	(O) I'm Sirin… This place is my world…
250777	(O) Your world? This place looks so desolate, do you feel lonely?
250778	(O) Lonely? What does it mean? I'm waiting for mom… Because mom said she would come back.
250779	(O) Really? You are waiting for the most important person in your life, however, you shouldn't just wait there, we need to do something to make the dream come true~
250780	(O) Do… something?
250781	(O) Yes~ Let me take you outside! Your mom must be there~
250782	(O) ……
250783	(O) Humph!
250784	(O) We are now in Dogma district… I can't enter this place when I don't have the permission.
250785	(O) Is Kiana here!? Kiana!
250786	(O) Wait a second! Don't move…
250787	(O) Dogma district… The roof was hit by the warship… I didn't expect Anti-entropy would use this way…
250788	(O) Bronya, can you tell me where is the Houkai energy fluctuation?
250789	(O) There is too much Houkai energy here… About fluctuation… Only one place is a little different, it's under the Moonlight throne.
250790	(O) Got it, get ready, now matter what's the situation of Kiana, don't move without my order, is that clear?
250791	(O) Roger that……
250792	(O) Hehehe…hehe… All conditions are ready! The final chapter begins! Human beings, let's welcome our new world god!
250793	(O) Dong!!
250794	(O) Ouch!!
250795	(O) Kiana!? Are you alright!
250796	(O) Mei!? You are fine! That's so great~
250797	(O) …… You didn't die.
250798	(O) Humph~ I won't die so easily! I have a lot of things need to do!
250799	(O) The first thing is stop you crazy woman!
250800	(O) Hoho… I hate you so much!
250801	(O) That's a good news! Let's reckoning!
250802	(O) Cocolia… Everything is over, your plan failed!
250803	(O) Hehe… No way, my daughter will make my dream come true……
250804	(O) Daughter… Do you mean Sirin? She is not your daughter!
250805	(O) !?
250806	Kiana! You met the second Herrscher!?
250807	Yeah, in a somewhat desolate place, a little girl was lonely waiting for her mom. So she invited me to go find her mom together. I also have to find my dad ...
250808	(O) Dong!!
250809	(O) Errr!!
250810	(O) Kiana… What happened?
250811	(O) Houkai energy alert! It's in… Kiana's body… It's the energy of "Herrscher" core…
250812	Ah ... uh, uhhhhhhh ... What's this ...!
250813	The second Herrscher... Fused with Kiana ...!?  No way, how could this happen?!
250814	(O) She can take that energy… Who is she… Wait, is your father's named Siegfried?
250815	(O) Errr… How do you know that?
250816	Huhhh ... hahaha!!!  It must be fate!  Kiana, you don't have to look for your father.  Siegfried is already——
250817	(O) Don't tell her!
250818	(O) DEAD!
250819	(O) What did you say?! No way!
250820	(O) Hehehe… Seems you don't know anything, according to my information, Siegfried was dead in 2012, in the battle of catch "Herrscher body". Maybe you are the "Herrscher body".
250821	(O) No way! It should be accidentally injure when we tried to arrest Siegfried and his daughter…
250822	(O) Theresa! Tell me she is lying to me! My dad is still alive!
250823	(O) Kiana… I…
250824	(O) Hehehe…… Seems there is some mistundertood in Shicksal~ I will tell you another truth…
250825	(O) Siegfried was dead because of taking too much Houkai energy… It means…
250826	He was killed by his "daughter", an experimental vessel for a Herrscher!
250827	(O) Ahhh…… No way… It's impossible! I killed my father… Noooo!! I don't believe you!!!
250828	Ahahaha ---! Face the facts!  You have the power to accept the core of a Herrscher. It's proof that you have an artificial body created by Shickal for the resurrection of the Second Herrscher!  You're the god of death, the one who destroy the world!//n(TN: CN/JP use present tense but EN uses past tense, I will assume it's a typo. Additionally, "God" is in quotes for CN/JP, so maybe something like "Grim Reaper" or "Hades" is more appropriate?)
250829	<b>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!</b>  No, that's a lie!!!  Ah, ah, no ...!!!  No, no, no!!!  I don't want to hear this anymore!!!!!!
250830	(O) Kiana! Calm down!
250831	(O) Houkai energy is still growing, will become new Houkai explosion, Mei, Theresa, we should leave here.
250832	(O) Kiana!!
250833	Ah, ah... All of you are lying to me!!!
250834	Yes, more hate!  Resent your incompetence and helplessness! Resent your powerlessness as a human being! (TN: Pretty sure I translated this one wrong)
250835	Stop Kiana! Don't let her fuse with the Herrscher core!
250836	(O) Hehe… She is not the ral "Herrscher" now, there is still one condition left, Mei… You need to return something~
250837	(O) We can't control the Houkai energy now… Armored Bunny, prepare for battle!
250838	(O) Kiana!!
250839	(O) Mei! Don't!
250840	(O) Kiana…… Kiana!!!

250856	(O) ……
250857	(O) Protect Mei! We still have chance to stop the Houkai explosion!
250858	Kiana... This isn't real! Wake up, please!
250859	That's no longer Kiana... It's just a doll controlled by the Second Herrscher.  We have to take Kiana back!
250860	(O) ……
250861	(O) Prepare for battle!
251457	Why... Kiana-chan, why did you do this...
