30001	XXX	<i>The night before the Honkai outbreak... I stayed up all night...</i>
30002	XXX	At 14:07:47, the Honkai outbreak took effect at Senba Academy. Estimated odds of survival are 0.000000001%
94189	XXX	{i}Huh, huh....!{/i} Those monsters aren't chasing me anymore...?
94190	XXX	The meteors that fell from the sky, and the people turning into monsters... Is this the 'Honkai' Dad was talking about?
94191	XXX	Daddy, where are you... why did you let go of Kiana's hand?! {i}Huu....{/i}
94192	XXX	*Rumble*
94193	XXX	Stop! I shouldn't be crying right now.
94194	XXX	Dad always told me. The Kaslana family has the power to beat the Honkai, and has a mission to save the world! It's Dad, so he's sure to head for the middle of the Honkai.
94195	XXX	The place where it exploded earlier is the center of the Honkai outbreak ... If I go there, I might find dad!
94196	XXX	But can I really find him by myself?
94197	XXX	That's no good! I have to be more courageous! I'm also a member of the Kaslana family. I can fight the Honkai, like Dad!
94198	XXX	*WHOOM*
94199	XXX	{i}Wuwu!{/i} These zombies... I'm not afraid of you!//n(TN: What?)
94200	XXX	This is the center of the Honkai ...?
94201	XXX	Daddy! Daddy!!! Where are you!??
94202	XXX	*rumble*
94205	XXX	Wait, is that a person?.... //n Hey~Have you seen my dad?
94207	XXX	Hello~ Can you hear me? Excuse me....
94208	XXX	Huh? What was I asking? {i}Uh,{/i} I feel dizzy...
94209	XXX	Kiana!
94210	XXX	Daddy, daddy? Is that you?
94211	XXX	Kiana, it's a relief, you aren't injured...
94212	XXX	Daddy! I finally found you... {i}Wuuuu...{/i}
94213	XXX	Kiana, listen carefully. Run away from here, right now. No matter what happens, do not stop. You must find safety!
94214	XXX	Daddy? What about daddy?!
94215	XXX	Don't worry. Daddy is the head of the Kaslana family. This kind of small Honkai outbreak won't hurt me!
94217	XXX	Haha~ It seems that Kiana is worried about me~ But don't you think you're thinking too lowly of your father?\n Don't worry. Dad will find you when he is done.
94218	XXX	Okay! It's a promise!
94219	XXX	Ah...
94220	XXX	Stupid, ignorant, arrogant, and insignificant human beings...
94222	XXX	Today, I will make the death bells toll for the human race.
94223	XXX	{i}Humph!{/i} Let's see if you can live up to those words, Herrscher!
94224	XXX	You, who made my daughter cry... I, Siegfried Kaslana, will show you no mercy!
94225	XXX	Hiyaaaaaaah!!
250001	XXX	<i>Tuuu, tuuu...</i> The number you are dialing is currently not available. Please leave a message after the beep.
250003	XXX	Hey. It's me, Kiana. I am currently at Senba Academy in Nagazora, in the Far East. I know you must be going after this Honkai outbreak. Just know that I will find you, no matter where you go!
250005	XXX	Huf... I talked enough. I didn't expect this outbreak to happen so suddenly. It should be a small outbreak. Let's assume the range covers the entire Senba Academy grounds.
250006	XXX	Next, I just have to find the target before 「Schicksal」arrives - this time, I'm not letting them get away!
250007	XXX	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
250008	XXX	Honkai infected zombies are already roaming... Good thing I made sure to prepare weapons in advance.
250009	XXX	<i>Click-tchack</i>
250010	XXX	Weapon inspection done. It seems fine. I have ammo... I really don't know how long these old guns will last.
250011	XXX	Well~ Regardless, let's follow the plan and get out of this library.
250012	XXX	I expected it, but there really are zombies on the escape route...
250013	XXX	Human beings, infected and mutated by the Honkai... with no more emotions, no more consciousness. //nLike walking corpses. Such sad creatures.
250014	XXX	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
250015	XXX	I'm sorry. Even still, I can't show you mercy.//n As a final favour, I will help you sleep in peace.
250016	XXX	{i} Click- BANG- BANG- BANG!---{/i}
250017	XXX	{i}Phew-{/i} I finally made it out of the library. So far so good. I should follow this plan, and find the target in the disaster area A.S.A.P.
250018	XXX	I'm currently here, and I should try to avoid places where zombies are crowded. Then the most effective route would be along Sakurakouji into the center of Senba Academy campus. Let's do it!
250019	XXX	Still... The usually loud and bustling academy feels so quiet now. It's really hard to get used to. Well, from now on, I don't have to try and be ladylike and accompany the other ladies to enjoy the flowers. That's one happy thing to come out of this, for now.
250020	XXX	Ah, hold on! Now's no time to get emotional! Obviously, there are more important things to deal with right now!
250021	XXX	{i} Pip pip pip {/i}
250022	XXX	Ooh! The detector on my phone found something, let me see~ There is reading for a Honkai energy source at 2 o'clock, 700 meters from here... Humph- That must be the center of this Honkai outbreak! The target must be there too!
250023	XXX	Hehe- Though I can't call you or anyone with the phone you left me, the extra features sure are effective. He probably never expected I would use this feature he designed himself to find him.
250024	XXX	All right, let's stick to the original plan!
250025	XXX	The Honkai energy source is 50 meters away now... I should be close enough to see it now.
250026	XXX	It should be right there- Tsk. Indeed, there are a lot of zombies gathered over there. Even for this girl, dealing with so many will be a challenge.
250027	XXX	Though, most zombies are dumb enough to move towards anything that makes a sound. If I use this weakness to my advantage, I can make things easier for myself.
250028	XXX	Looks like we'll have to take a detour. First, I should make a sound to attract their attention, and then go around and approach from the left side.
250030	XXX	Eh?! Wha?! What was that sound? I haven't done anything yet! Uh... Thunder?! But it was sunny just now, why did it suddenly...
250032	XXX	Uh... whoops. They saw me.
250033	XXX	Ah, forget it. In that case, breaking through is the only option!
250034	XXX	<i>Hah, hah-</i> There's no end to them. I hadn't expected the zombies to come swarming to the Honkai source here. It will be a bit of a problem if this keeps going.
250035	XXX	Almost out of ammo, almost out of time... I have to find the target, fast.
250037	XXX	Who's there?!
250038	XXX	That figure doesn't seem like a zombie... could it be?! I finally found you! Wait!
250040	XXX	Eh?! This is... a student? I didn't think there were still people who hadn't been infected by the Honkai...
250041	XXX	Your uniform, it's the one used for senior students. What's your name?
250043	XXX	Hey, are you not all there? Could you like maybe... answer?
250045	XXX	Ah... Maybe you're too scared to talk? That's okay... I can't help you right now, so you'd better find a place to hide somewhere.
250047	XXX	Gee, it's not safe here! If you've given up on trying to survive, then nobody can help you. Even if I take you with me, you'll just slow me down. Goodbye, don't blame me.
250050	XXX	Ugh! Just my luck. Come with me!
250051	XXX	{i}Huf...huf...{/i} Seems like escorting a normal person whilst fighting zombies is a bit much... Hey, you okay?
250053	XXX	{i} Tsk {/i} I'm such an idiot. Why did I help this girl? She doesn't even say a word of thanks. And I've been busting my butt off!
250054	XXX	Just stay here. This is the old school building. The zombies won't find it for a while. I'm not staying here to help you anymore. You'll have to fend for yourself.
250055	XXX	........Why did you help me?
250056	XXX	Eh? You finally said something?
250057	XXX	A person like me should die... Maybe even being born was a mistake...
250058	XXX	Ha? What are you on about? How could someone even say that about herself?
250059	XXX	Just leave me be. You can stop pretending to care. You just approached me because of the name 'Raiden Mei'.
250060	XXX	'Raiden Mei'? I think I've heard that name before... Isn't she a celebrity in Senba Academy? The daughter of the president of ME Company! Is that you?
250062	XXX	Oh... The same rich girl who is said to have rejected 12 boys in one day and earned the nickname 'Thunder Queen'. Yet you're looking so ashamed and dejected. What a rare sight.
250063	XXX	Are you just going to mock me too? Sure enough, everyone's rotten on the inside.
250064	XXX	Don't be mistaken, I'm not here to laugh at you. I just mean to say that instead of blaming other people or being angry at the heavens, it's better to find ways to change yourself instead.
250065	XXX	Change? That's right... It's not me who is the problem, it's this sickening world! This deceitful world should be destroyed!
250066	XXX	Uh, that doesn't seem right... Hello?! What happened to you?!
250068	XXX	Huh? What is going on with this weather? Could it be some sort of abnormal effect caused by the Honkai outbreak?
250070	XXX	Gee, for the phone to react at this moment...okay! Detected high Honkai energy reading... Distance 0 meters?
250072	XXX	Huh? The signal broke? Why would this phone fail at such a critical moment! Isn't 0 meters away right next to me? There's nobody here except for a troubled rich girl!
250073	XXX	If this deceitful world is destroyed... All can return to how it was before... My father... everyone... will surely return to me.
250074	XXX	Hey, where are you going! Wait for me!\n(TN: Couldn't undestand the middle sentence, check multilanguage)
250076	XXX	So annoying! Where did that girl go? Really... Why should I waste so much time on this stranger!
250079	XXX	Hehehe, everyone is with me. As long as I have my father, and everyone I care about, then nothing else matters.
250080	XXX	There she is! Oh no! That girl is surrounded by zombies!
250082	XXX	You bastards! Leave that girl alone!!
250083	XXX	Who are you? Have you come to ruin my happiness again?
250084	XXX	What kind of nonsense is that? I'm here to save you!
250085	XXX	Go away! I don't need your pity.
250087	XXX	Ugh, what's going on with the zombies surrounding her?
250088	XXX	Everything... Everything should just DISAPPEAR! //n<size=30>(TN: This doesn't translate well to english, but in JP it's "everything... Everything everything everything should just DISAPPEAR!")</size>
250089	XXX	Hey! Where are you going?! Dammit... when I'm done cleaning up these zombies, I'll have to teach that unstable missy a lesson. //n(TN: she's specifically referred to as a 'lady'/ojousama in Japanese)
250090	XXX	Finally, I caught up!
250091	XXX	Wait for a bit. Father, just a little longer... and Mei can become what you want her to be.
250092	XXX	What's going on with her? It's like she became a different person.
250093	XXX	And the way the zombies are acting... They're so close, but instead of attacking her, they slowed down and started following her...?
250094	XXX	Ahhh~ What a joyous feeling. Everyone, the whole world, is with me... No one will abandon me anymore, everyone will enjoy the happiness of eternity by my side!
250095	XXX	Hahaha~ Raiden Mei, let me help you make your desires a reality.
250096	XXX	Why do you look like that?! You're not Raiden Mei! Who are you?!
250097	XXX	Hahahaha~ Cute little kitten, it doesn't matter who I am~ Because soon, you will become a burnt corpse and join the rest of them.
250099	XXX	Woah! How did lightning strike all of a sudden?!
250100	XXX	Ohoho~ Well done avoiding that. It seems like you will be good practice for me. Let me torture you slowly~
250101	XXX	Who the hell are you?! Nobody outside of the Kaslana bloodline can survive in this Honkai heavy environment!
250102	XXX	Hah. It no longer matters who I am. Raiden Mei no longer exists, and I am here to bring this wretched world to its destruction in her place!
250104	XXX	The lightning energy is coursing through her... If this is a phenomenon caused by the Honkai, could she be absorbing the Honkai energy around her?
250105	XXX	So there are human beings in this world that can directly manipulate Honkai energy without external help. It's the only possible explanation I can think of...
250106	XXX	Ah, I think this could be pretty bad... But it's too early to be all doom and gloom! If you think about it from another angle, maybe I'll end up being the world's saviour!
250107	XXX	I have to find a way to stop her!
250108	XXX	Hah! Such spirit! Let's see you give it a try!
250110	XXX	Out of my way!
250111	XXX	Hmph! That was careless of me. To think I would be tricked by a little girl like you. Looks like I will need to absorb more power-
250112	XXX	I won't let you!
250113	XXX	Eh?! What are you up to?!
250114	XXX	The Kaslana family bloodline is completely resistant to the Honkai! If my body can withstand the Honkai, I can cut you off from the source of your Honkai energy!
250115	XXX	Asshole! Stay away! Don't touch me!
250116	XXX	{i} UUUrgh {/i} A surge of Honkai... directly into my body. This is the first time I've felt this much energy- It hurts!!
250117	XXX	Please... Help...
250118	XXX	Father! Please help... Don't leave Mei!
250119	XXX	This is... a piece of consciousness passed on through the Honkai energy?
250120	XXX	Father! Why did you leave me?! Why does everybody hate me?! Why?! Why?! Why?!
250121	XXX	This world can be damned for all I care!
250122	XXX	Don't pry into my heart!
250123	XXX	Ack!
250124	XXX	Damn it! I just need more power, then no one can hurt me anymore!
250125	XXX	Wait, stop! You're being taken over by the Honkai! If you absorb more Honkai energy, you will lose your mind! If that happens, it might be too late!
250126	XXX	Humph~ Don't tell me such ridiculous lies! I can see right through you, you're the same as the rest of them! They were jealous of my status and family, and you are jealous of my power!
250127	XXX	I will never forgive you... Just you wait!
250128	XXX	Hey, wait! Don't run away!
250130	XXX	Stormy clouds are now gathering above the main school building... Raiden Mei also left in that direction. The weather changes are definitely also her doing.
250131	XXX	He once told me there is a special kind of large scale Honkai outbreak, a cataclysm that can destroy the entire planet... But the scariest part is not the Honkai itself, but the creature born from the Honkai...
250132	XXX	A human body saturated with Honkai energy, stripped from a human mind. It becomes an entity made only for destruction and ruin. It is the strongest monster created by the Honkai- The Herrscher.
250133	XXX	Given the current situation, it is very likely that this is the case here.
250134	XXX	I didn't think that this would be such a troublesome outbreak, and I'm worried I might be in over my head here.
250135	XXX	Forget it... It's pointless to dwell on it any longer, I just hope things don't take a turn for the worse.
250136	XXX	Since the Honkai is already here, we shouldn't miss this opportunity! He should also be nearby and going after the same goal as me. And Raiden Mei, she must be the center of this outbreak.
250137	XXX	To defeat this troublesome senpai, I'm afraid brute force alone won't do the trick. Those thoughts that were transferred through the Honkai energy earlier, those might be the key to waking her up.
250139	XXX	Agh, this useless phone... It keeps beeping at the worst times, stop it!
250140	XXX	It's not even necessary right now. There's a huge vortex of storm clouds looming overhead, and there are zombies all over... I can tell this place is super bad news with my gut feeling.
250141	XXX	If I really end up dying here this time... No! Bad! I shouldn't be thinking so negatively. I, Kiana Kaslana, won't fall so easily!
250142	XXX	That's right! Until I find him, I can never give up!
250143	XXX	Haha~ Lovely little school girl, you really are determined to die, aren't you? It is really touching~ As a reward for you, I'll give you a chance to say some last words.
250144	XXX	As last words, let me tell you a story about a senpai of mine.
250146	XXX	She lost her mother when she was very young, and has never felt a mother's love. And her father, he treated her like a tool, cultivated her to be the heir of his company.
250147	XXX	In order to live up to her father's expectations, this senpai worked hard to be better than anyone else. She gave up her opporunity to live happy and carefree like other girls her age. She suffered on her own accord, and she drove herself into a corner. All of it to be the most amazing person, so that her father would love her and treat her as a daughter.
250149	XXX	When she went to school, the senpai earned the love and respect of her teachers and classmates with her excellent grades and lovely appearance.
250150	XXX	But still, she did not get her father's approval. Slowly, senpai gave up all hope. It didn't matter if she was no more than a tool, at least her classmates and her teachers would acknowledge her. But then, a month ago something happened that shattered her hopes and dreams.
250151	XXX	Stop talking!! Don't make me remember those things!!!
250153	XXX	Senpai's father was arrested after committing economic crimes with his company, and he lost his original social status. Senpai, she thought her classmates and teachers would try to comfort her. But they treated her completely differently.
250154	XXX	It turned out the world was not as friendly as she had thought, and the people around her had only flattered her because they feared her grand halo.
250155	XXX	After losing all these things, she became nothing. She couldn't even be her father's tool anymore.
250156	XXX	Don't act as if you know me so well!! It's true, I have nothing left, everyone betrayed me! But I don't need them anymore!
250157	XXX	Even if I am alone... In can survive in this world of Honkai! The power I wield is the proof of how valuable I am!
250158	XXX	{i}The mind that was being suppressed by the Honkai finally seems to be resurfacing. If she can completely recover herself, that should be enough to save her.{/i}
250160	XXX	But you have to live! Not for the name Raiden Mei, or your father's family business, not for the goodwill, mercy, or charity of others! Live for yourself!
250162	XXX	Mei-senpai! Come and grab my hand! I will help you get rid of the Honkai in your body!
250163	XXX	Can I really trust you?
250164	XXX	Yes! I swear! I won't deceive you!
250165	XXX	You are the first person to reach out to me like this... Thank you.
250167	XXX	Mei-senpai?!
250168	XXX	This girl can't turn back anymore! She will become the goddess of death that brings destruction to this world!
250169	XXX	It's you! You're the other personality created by the Honkai! Get out of Mei-senpai's head!
250170	XXX	{i}Ha ha...{/i} When I completely overtake her spirit, you won't stand a chance!
250171	XXX	You asshole! Get back here!
250172	XXX	Damn it, almost succeeded... This is so frustrating! That {i}thing{/i} from before seems like it has taken control over Mei's body.
250173	XXX	It's getting darker, and it will become more and more dangerous the longer this goes on... I've deviated a lot from the original plan, but I've chosen this path. I must finish this!
250174	XXX	When the city lights went dim, I realised that the night sky is so mesmerising. If it weren't for the thunderclouds above me, the view would be amazing~
250176	XXX	Please... Stay away, leave me be! I can't suppress it anymore. I don't want to be its puppet!
250177	XXX	Mei-senpai! Don't give up! Don't let the Honkai consume you!
250178	XXX	No... I'm too tired to keep on living, and I don't have the strength to fight anymore. If I die now, perhaps I will find peace.
250179	XXX	Senpai! What are you doing?!
250180	XXX	Thank you ... I'm glad I met you at the end. Jumping here now seems to be the best choice I can make.
250181	XXX	Don't--!!
250183	XXX	She jumped down. In the end, I didn't make any difference! And I was so close!
250186	XXX	Ha ha ha ha!
250188	XXX	What are you so sad about? I finally obtained this body, would I really let it die so easily?
250189	XXX	You again!
250190	XXX	Hee he he~ Don't worry, Raiden Mei will not be alone, I will always be with her~ And I will fulfill all of her wishes.
250191	XXX	First of which: Simply killing you, you annoying school girl!
250192	XXX	As if! I'll definitely bring her back!
250193	XXX	Impossible... I was actually defeated by such a human...
250194	XXX	Senpai! Senpai! Wake up!
250195	XXX	I'm alive...
250196	XXX	Wouldn't it be okay to let a person like me die? Why would you risk your life to save me?
250197	XXX	Hu~ I don't know. When you shared your thoughts with me, I recognised a little of myself in them. Maybe I just did it for myself.
250198	XXX	Can you tell me your name?
250199	XXX	Kiana Kaslana. I'm just a school girl who happened to pass by for personal reasons.
250200	XXX	What a strange person...
250201	XXX	To me, Senpai is also a strange person! Actually being able to survive such a violent Honkai outbreak. And there is stil...
250202	XXX	What is it?
250203	XXX	No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it Senpai~ It's over now.
250204	XXX	Just call me Mei. This 'Honkai' you just mentioned. Is that the name of this disaster?
250205	XXX	Well~ It's a bit of a headache to explain this problem. On the surface, Honkai is as you can see: A phenomenon that leads to the destruction of the world and the demise of mankind.
250207	XXX	The world ending Honkai, whether you can accept it now or not, is a phenomenon that occurs periodically. Right now, human knowledge cannot explain what the cause is, and it can only be said to be an unpredictable disaster.
250208	XXX	It can take many forms: Wars, infectious diseases, climate disasters, meteor strikes... Even godlike warriors can suddenly appear.
250209	XXX	For example, a recent large-scale Honkai outbreak, the Black Death in the 14th century, directly or indirectly caused the destruction of one third of the world's population.
250210	XXX	Then, what was eroding my body just earlier?
250211	XXX	That is the source of Honkai energy, which will accompany the Honkai, and it is an energy that can distort the rules of the world. It's presumed to be an indispensable element for causing the Honkai, and the nature of its existence is also hard to get a read on.
250212	XXX	However, it seems to have a significant tendency towards consciousness, though that's not in any of the records. Maybe something similar has happened before, that was then classified.
250213	XXX	Has it left me now?
250214	XXX	I don't know it either. Maybe it left, or maybe it's sleeping inside of Mei-senpai somewhere. But I think as long as Mei-senpai stays strong willed and sticks to her heart, it will definitely not reappear~
250215	XXX	Mh, thank you.
250216	XXX	Hey~ You're welcome! As a partner, this is a must~
250217	XXX	Partner? This is the first time someone considers me a partner.
250218	XXX	Mei-senpai? What's wrong?
250219	XXX	It's nothing, there is a feeling in my heart that I have never had before. But, can someone like me really become a companion? I killed them, I wanted to curse the world. I...I...
250220	XXX	No, all of that wasn't Mei-senpai's fault. It was the Honkai enacting judgement upon humanity.
250221	XXX	In my opinion, there is no absolute good and evil in this world. There was never such a thing before, and I don't think there ever will be in this broken world.
250222	XXX	Because of your will, you managed to survive. Those who are weak, who gave up their belief in survival, have long since become zombies. No matter what kind of beliefs you hold, to survive is the most meaningful thing.
250223	XXX	Can I really be your partner?
250224	XXX	Please watch my back, and fight beside me.
250680	XXX	Death... Death is simply the beginning of eternal life.  When God's messenger descends, all sins will be forgiven.  Only when you've chosen death will your soul be freed!//n(TN: CN says heart, JP says mind, I'm going to guess they meant it metaphorically)
250682	XXX	Who would accept such a negative ending!  People are valuable because they are alive.  No one has the right to take another person's life!
250683	XXX	Ha, it's no use what a stupid little girl like you does now. The Scale of Providence leaned toward Anti-Entropy.  It's time for all of humanity to be freed!//n(TN: Insert komm susser tod here)
250684	XXX	Is that so? Then I'll teach "god" a lesson!
250687	XXX	Kiana, stop messing around! The current situation is not easy to overcome. Follow my orders and escape from the battleship!
250697	XXX	That's right... Kiana! I won't let you fight alone! Let's stop this catastrophe together!
250855	XXX	Cocolia... Was swallowed by the Honkai energy inside the smelter...
250859	XXX	That's no longer Kiana... It's just a doll controlled by the Second Herrscher.  We have to take Kiana back!
251063	XXX	There's a thunderstorm ahead... This should be the right way.
251064	XXX	But where am I now?  It's a place I've never seen, but... Was there really a place like this at the school?
251065	XXX	And this is an abandoned building, isn't it? It doesn't seem right for such a run-down building to be in such a modern academy...//n(TN: A bit verbose, maybe it's better to redo it closer to EN?)
251072	XXX	And what's this smell... Yeesh, it's awful...  No way, is all the chemical wastewater and contaminated water from the school ending up here...?
251074	XXX	The world-famous academy is doing something illegal like this... It's got a gorgeous appearance, but it's polluting the city behind that façade.
251075	XXX	There's even a warning sign to prevent people from entering. I wouldn't have seen this for the rest of my life if I didn't try following those engine sounds.
251457	XXX	Why... Kiana-chan, why did you do this...
251459	XXX	Why did you kill them all....
251461	XXX	Those who try to stop me... Will be killed!
251462	XXX	Kiana!! You said you wanted to protect this world, didn't you?!!!
251463	XXX	I'll definitely stop you!!!//n(TN: Not sure if the meaning is correct here, she might be saying it with more seriousness)
251464	XXX	It's useless... You cannot stop me.
251465	XXX	I... Obey the will. I will...  Destroy humanity...
251468	XXX	The process can no longer be stopped...
251469	XXX	Death is the beginning of a new life.  The soul of mankind will be reverted to the beginning, and the world will return to peace...
251470	XXX	Let us join together and complete the Final Ceremony.
251472	XXX	...Why are you crying?
251473	XXX	Why... It hurts so much...
251475	XXX	I'm sorry....
251476	XXX	At least in the end... Let's go back together.
251477	XXX	Back to everyone...
251478	XXX	Good bye.
251479	XXX	The Honkai Eruption occurred and all life forms were reduced to nothing. (TN: Honkai Impact?)
251480	XXX	[Confirmation received. The condition has been met. Preparing the rebirth module——]
251481	XXX	[DNA reading started ——Restart cycle setting completed]
251482	XXX	[Program execution countdown initiated]
251483	XXX	[Program execution started ——Number of recording cycles: 2]
251485	XXX	If there is a god in this world...
251486	XXX	Will he listen to my prayers?
251487	XXX	If reincarnation really exists...
251488	XXX	Please let me meet her again.
251489	XXX	——「See you in the next world.」
251490	XXX	This is Kiana. I've just arrived at Senba High School, awaiting further instructions.
