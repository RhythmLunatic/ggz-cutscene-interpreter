What about daddy?!", "94215": "Don't worry. Daddy is the head of the Kaslana family. This kind of small Honkai outbreak won't hurt me!", "94217": "Haha~ It seems that Kiana is worried about me~ But don't you think you're thinking too lowly of your father?//n Don't worry.

Just know that I will find you, no matter where you go!", "250005": "Huf... I talked enough. I didn't expect this outbreak to happen so suddenly. It should be a small outbreak. Let's assume the range covers the entire Senba Academy grounds.", "250006": "Next, I just have to find the target before 「Schicksal」arrives - this time, I'm not letting them get away!", "250007": "Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---", "250008": "Honkai infected zombies are already roaming...

So far so good. I should follow this plan, and find the target in the disaster area A.S.A.P.", "250018": "I'm currently here, and I should try to avoid places where zombies are crowded. Then the most effective route would be along Sakurakouji into the center of Senba Academy campus. Let's do it!", "250019": "Still... The usually loud and bustling academy feels so quiet now. It's really hard to get used to. Well, from now on, I don't have to try and be ladylike and accompany the other ladies to enjoy the flowers.

Obviously, there are more important things to deal with right now!", "250021": "<i> Pip pip pip </i>", "250022": "Ooh! The detector on my phone found something, let me see~ There is reading for a Honkai energy source at 2 o'clock, 700 meters from here... Humph- That must be the center of this Honkai outbreak! The target must be there too!", "250023": "Hehe- Though I can't call you or anyone with the phone you left me, the extra features sure are effective. He probably never expected I would use this feature he designed himself to find him.", "250024": "All right, let's stick to the original plan!", "250025": "The Honkai energy source is 50 meters away now... I should be close enough to see it now.", "250026": "It should be right there- Tsk. Indeed, there are a lot of zombies gathered over there. Even for this girl, dealing with so many will be a challenge.", "250027": "Though, most zombies are dumb enough to move towards anything that makes a sound. If I use this weakness to my advantage, I can make things easier for myself.", "250028": "Looks like we'll have to take a detour. First, I should make a sound to attract their attention, and then go around and approach from the left side.", "250030": "Eh?! Wha?! What was that sound? I haven't done anything yet! Uh... Thunder?! But it was sunny just now, why did it suddenly...", "250032": "Uh... whoops. They saw me.", "250033": "Ah, forget it. In that case, breaking through is the only option!", "250034": "<i>Hah, hah-</i> There's no end to them. I hadn't expected the zombies to come swarming to the Honkai source here.

I have to find the target, fast.", "250037": "Who's there?!", "250038": "That figure doesn't seem like a zombie... could it be?! I finally found you! Wait!", "250040": "Eh?! This is... a student? I didn't think there were still people who hadn't been infected by the Honkai...", "250041": "Your uniform, it's the one used for senior students. What's your name?", "250043": "Hey, are you not all there? Could you like maybe... answer?", "250045": "Ah... Maybe you're too scared to talk? That's okay... I can't help you right now, so you'd better find a place to hide somewhere.", "250047": "Gee, it's not safe here! If you've given up on trying to survive, then nobody can help you. Even if I take you with me, you'll just slow me down. Goodbye, don't blame me.", "250050": "Ugh! Just my luck. Come with me!", "250051": "<i>Huf...huf...</i> Seems like escorting a normal person whilst fighting zombies is a bit much... Hey, you okay?", "250053": "<i> Tsk </i> I'm such an idiot. Why did I help this girl? She doesn't even say a word of thanks. And I've been busting my butt off!", "250054": "Just stay here. This is the old school building. The zombies won't find it for a while. I'm not staying here to help you anymore. You'll have to fend for yourself.", "250055": "........Why did you help me?", "250056": "Eh? You finally said something?", "250057": "A person like me should die... Maybe even being born was a mistake...", "250058": "Ha? What are you on about? How could someone even say that about herself?", "250059": "Just leave me be. You can stop pretending to care. You just approached me because of the name 'Raiden Mei'.", "250060": "'Raiden Mei'? I think I've heard that name before... Isn't she a celebrity in Senba Academy? The daughter of the president of ME Company! Is that you?", "250062": "Oh... The same rich girl who is said to have rejected 12 boys in one day and earned the nickname 'Thunder Queen'. Yet you're looking so ashamed and dejected. What a rare sight.", "250063": "Are you just going to mock me too? Sure enough, everyone's rotten on the inside.", "250064": "Don't be mistaken, I'm not here to laugh at you. I just mean to say that instead of blaming other people or being angry at the heavens, it's better to find ways to change yourself instead.", "250065": "Change? That's right... It's not me who is the problem, it's this sickening world! This deceitful world should be destroyed!", "250066": "Uh, that doesn't seem right... Hello?! What happened to you?!", "250068": "Huh? What is going on with this weather? Could it be some sort of abnormal effect caused by the Honkai outbreak?", "250070": "Gee, for the phone to react at this moment...okay! Detected high Honkai energy reading... Distance 0 meters?", "250072": "Huh? The signal broke? Why would this phone fail at such a critical moment! Isn't 0 meters away right next to me? There's nobody here except for a troubled rich girl!", "250073": "If this deceitful world is destroyed... All can return to how it was before... My father... everyone... will surely return to me.", "250074": "Hey, where are you going! Wait for me!//n(TN: Couldn't undestand the middle sentence, check multilanguage)", "250076": "So annoying! Where did that girl go? Really... Why should I waste so much time on this stranger!", "250079": "Hehehe, everyone is with me. As long as I have my father, and everyone I care about, then nothing else matters.", "250080": "There she is! Oh no! That girl is surrounded by zombies!", "250082": "You bastards! Leave that girl alone!!", "250083": "Who are you? Have you come to ruin my happiness again?", "250084": "What kind of nonsense is that? I'm here to save you!", "250085": "Go away! I don't need your pity.", "250087": "Ugh, what's going on with the zombies surrounding her?", "250088": "Everything...

Father, just a little longer... and Mei can become what you want her to be.", "250092": "What's going on with her? It's like she became a different person.", "250093": "And the way the zombies are acting... They're so close, but instead of attacking her, they slowed down and started following her...?", "250094": "Ahhh~ What a joyous feeling. Everyone, the whole world, is with me... No one will abandon me anymore, everyone will enjoy the happiness of eternity by my side!", "250095": "Hahaha~ Raiden Mei, let me help you make your desires a reality.", "250096": "Why do you look like that?! You're not Raiden Mei! Who are you?!", "250097": "Hahahaha~ Cute little kitten, it doesn't matter who I am~ Because soon, you will become a burnt corpse and join the rest of them.", "250099": "Woah! How did lightning strike all of a sudden?!", "250100": "Ohoho~ Well done avoiding that. It seems like you will be good practice for me. Let me torture you slowly~", "250101": "Who the hell are you?! Nobody outside of the Kaslana bloodline can survive in this Honkai heavy environment!", "250102": "Hah. It no longer matters who I am. Raiden Mei no longer exists, and I am here to bring this wretched world to its destruction in her place!", "250104": "The lightning energy is coursing through her... If this is a phenomenon caused by the Honkai, could she be absorbing the Honkai energy around her?", "250105": "So there are human beings in this world that can directly manipulate Honkai energy without external help. It's the only possible explanation I can think of...", "250106": "Ah, I think this could be pretty bad... But it's too early to be all doom and gloom! If you think about it from another angle, maybe I'll end up being the world's saviour!", "250107": "I have to find a way to stop her!", "250108": "Hah! Such spirit! Let's see you give it a try!", "250110": "Out of my way!", "250111": "Hmph! That was careless of me. To think I would be tricked by a little girl like you. Looks like I will need to absorb more power-", "250112": "I won't let you!", "250113": "Eh?! What are you up to?!", "250114": "The Kaslana family bloodline is completely resistant to the Honkai! If my body can withstand the Honkai, I can cut you off from the source of your Honkai energy!", "250115": "Asshole! Stay away! Don't touch me!", "250116": "<i> UUUrgh </i> A surge of Honkai... directly into my body. This is the first time I've felt this much energy- It hurts!!", "250117": "Please... Help...", "250118": "Father! Please help... Don't leave Mei!", "250119": "This is... a piece of consciousness passed on through the Honkai energy?", "250120": "Father! Why did you leave me?! Why does everybody hate me?! Why?! Why?! Why?!", "250121": "This world can be damned for all I care!", "250122": "Don't pry into my heart!", "250123": "Ack!", "250124": "Damn it! I just need more power, then no one can hurt me anymore!", "250125": "Wait, stop! You're being taken over by the Honkai! If you absorb more Honkai energy, you will lose your mind! If that happens, it might be too late!", "250126": "Humph~ Don't tell me such ridiculous lies! I can see right through you, you're the same as the rest of them! They were jealous of my status and family, and you are jealous of my power!", "250127": "I will never forgive you... Just you wait!", "250128": "Hey, wait! Don't run away!", "250130": "Stormy clouds are now gathering above the main school building... Raiden Mei also left in that direction. The weather changes are definitely also her doing.", "250131": "He once told me there is a special kind of large scale Honkai outbreak, a cataclysm that can destroy the entire planet... But the scariest part is not the Honkai itself, but the creature born from the Honkai...", "250132": "A human body saturated with Honkai energy, stripped from a human mind. It becomes an entity made only for destruction and ruin. It is the strongest monster created by the Honkai- The Herrscher.", "250133": "Given the current situation, it is very likely that this is the case here.", "250134": "I didn't think that this would be such a troublesome outbreak, and I'm worried I might be in over my head here.", "250135": "Forget it... It's pointless to dwell on it any longer, I just hope things don't take a turn for the worse.", "250136": "Since the Honkai is already here, we shouldn't miss this opportunity! He should also be nearby and going after the same goal as me. And Raiden Mei, she must be the center of this outbreak.", "250137": "To defeat this troublesome senpai, I'm afraid brute force alone won't do the trick. Those thoughts that were transferred through the Honkai energy earlier, those might be the key to waking her up.", "250139": "Agh, this useless phone... It keeps beeping at the worst times, stop it!", "250140": "It's not even necessary right now. There's a huge vortex of storm clouds looming overhead, and there are zombies all over... I can tell this place is super bad news with my gut feeling.", "250141": "If I really end up dying here this time... No! Bad! I shouldn't be thinking so negatively. I, Kiana Kaslana, won't fall so easily!", "250142": "That's right! Until I find him, I can never give up!", "250143": "Haha~ Lovely little school girl, you really are determined to die, aren't you? It is really touching~ As a reward for you, I'll give you a chance to say some last words.", "250144": "As last words, let me tell you a story about a senpai of mine.", "250146": "She lost her mother when she was very young, and has never felt a mother's love. And her father, he treated her like a tool, cultivated her to be the heir of his company.", "250147": "In order to live up to her father's expectations, this senpai worked hard to be better than anyone else. She gave up her opporunity to live happy and carefree like other girls her age. She suffered on her own accord, and she drove herself into a corner. All of it to be the most amazing person, so that her father would love her and treat her as a daughter.", "250149": "When she went to school, the senpai earned the love and respect of her teachers and classmates with her excellent grades and lovely appearance.", "250150": "But still, she did not get her father's approval. Slowly, senpai gave up all hope. It didn't matter if she was no more than a tool, at least her classmates and her teachers would acknowledge her. But then, a month ago something happened that shattered her hopes and dreams.", "250151": "Stop talking!! Don't make me remember those things!!!", "250153": "Senpai's father was arrested after committing economic crimes with his company, and he lost his original social status. Senpai, she thought her classmates and teachers would try to comfort her. But they treated her completely differently.", "250154": "It turned out the world was not as friendly as she had thought, and the people around her had only flattered her because they feared her grand halo.", "250155": "After losing all these things, she became nothing. She couldn't even be her father's tool anymore.", "250156": "Don't act as if you know me so well!! It's true, I have nothing left, everyone betrayed me! But I don't need them anymore!", "250157": "Even if I am alone... In can survive in this world of Honkai! The power I wield is the proof of how valuable I am!", "250158": "<i>The mind that was being suppressed by the Honkai finally seems to be resurfacing. If she can completely recover herself, that should be enough to save her.</i>", "250160": "But you have to live! Not for the name Raiden Mei, or your father's family business, not for the goodwill, mercy, or charity of others! Live for yourself!", "250162": "Mei-senpai! Come and grab my hand! I will help you get rid of the Honkai in your body!", "250163": "Can I really trust you?", "250164": "Yes! I swear! I won't deceive you!", "250165": "You are the first person to reach out to me like this... Thank you.", "250167": "Mei-senpai?!", "250168": "This girl can't turn back anymore! She will become the goddess of death that brings destruction to this world!", "250169": "It's you! You're the other personality created by the Honkai! Get out of Mei-senpai's head!", "250170": "<i>Ha ha...</i> When I completely overtake her spirit, you won't stand a chance!", "250171": "You asshole! Get back here!", "250172": "Damn it, almost succeeded... This is so frustrating! That <i>thing</i> from before seems like it has taken control over Mei's body.", "250173": "It's getting darker, and it will become more and more dangerous the longer this goes on... I've deviated a lot from the original plan, but I've chosen this path. I must finish this!", "250174": "When the city lights went dim, I realised that the night sky is so mesmerising. If it weren't for the thunderclouds above me, the view would be amazing~", "250176": "Please... Stay away, leave me be! I can't suppress it anymore. I don't want to be its puppet!", "250177": "Mei-senpai! Don't give up! Don't let the Honkai consume you!", "250178": "No... I'm too tired to keep on living, and I don't have the strength to fight anymore. If I die now, perhaps I will find peace.", "250179": "Senpai! What are you doing?!", "250180": "Thank you ... I'm glad I met you at the end. Jumping here now seems to be the best choice I can make.", "250181": "Don't--!!", "250183": "She jumped down. In the end, I didn't make any difference! And I was so close!", "250186": "Ha ha ha ha!", "250188": "What are you so sad about? I finally obtained this body, would I really let it die so easily?", "250189": "You again!", "250190": "Hee he he~ Don't worry, Raiden Mei will not be alone, I will always be with her~ And I will fulfill all of her wishes.", "250191": "First of which: Simply killing you, you annoying school girl!", "250192": "As if! I'll definitely bring her back!", "250193": "Impossible... I was actually defeated by such a human...", "250194": "Senpai! Senpai! Wake up!", "250195": "I'm alive...", "250196": "Wouldn't it be okay to let a person like me die? Why would you risk your life to save me?", "250197": "Hu~ I don't know. When you shared your thoughts with me, I recognised a little of myself in them. Maybe I just did it for myself.", "250198": "Can you tell me your name?", "250199": "Kiana Kaslana. I'm just a school girl who happened to pass by for personal reasons.", "250200": "What a strange person...", "250201": "To me, Senpai is also a strange person! Actually being able to survive such a violent Honkai outbreak. And there is stil...", "250202": "What is it?", "250203": "No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it Senpai~ It's over now.", "250204": "Just call me Mei. This 'Honkai' you just mentioned. Is that the name of this disaster?", "250205": "Well~ It's a bit of a headache to explain this problem. On the surface, Honkai is as you can see: A phenomenon that leads to the destruction of the world and the demise of mankind.", "250207": "The world ending Honkai, whether you can accept it now or not, is a phenomenon that occurs periodically. Right now, human knowledge cannot explain what the cause is, and it can only be said to be an unpredictable disaster.", "250208": "It can take many forms: Wars, infectious diseases, climate disasters, meteor strikes... Even godlike warriors can suddenly appear.", "250209": "For example, a recent large-scale Honkai outbreak, the Black Death in the 14th century, directly or indirectly caused the destruction of one third of the world's population.", "250210": "Then, what was eroding my body just earlier?", "250211": "That is the source of Honkai energy, which will accompany the Honkai, and it is an energy that can distort the rules of the world. It's presumed to be an indispensable element for causing the Honkai, and the nature of its existence is also hard to get a read on.", "250212": "However, it seems to have a significant tendency towards consciousness, though that's not in any of the records. Maybe something similar has happened before, that was then classified.", "250213": "Has it left me now?", "250214": "I don't know it either. Maybe it left, or maybe it's sleeping inside of Mei-senpai somewhere. But I think as long as Mei-senpai stays strong willed and sticks to her heart, it will definitely not reappear~", "250215": "Mh, thank you.", "250216": "Hey~ You're welcome! As a partner, this is a must~", "250217": "Partner? This is the first time someone considers me a partner.", "250218": "Mei-senpai? What's wrong?", "250219": "It's nothing, there is a feeling in my heart that I have never had before. But, can someone like me really become a companion? I killed them, I wanted to curse the world. I...I...", "250220": "No, all of that wasn't Mei-senpai's fault. It was the Honkai enacting judgement upon humanity.", "250221": "In my opinion, there is no absolute good and evil in this world. There was never such a thing before, and I don't think there ever will be in this broken world.", "250222": "Because of your will, you managed to survive. Those who are weak, who gave up their belief in survival, have long since become zombies. No matter what kind of beliefs you hold, to survive is the most meaningful thing.", "250223": "Can I really be your partner?", "250224": "Please watch my back, and fight beside me.", "250680": "Death...

Why are we surrounded by zombies?!", "251167": "I think she's attracting the zombies.", "251168": "She... You mean that girl with a tail?", "251169": "Right!

Isn't it more likely that she brought me here to kill me?", "61575": "Sin wouldn't consider that. Shin was weird when she met, but she was still a kind-hearted child.", "61576": "Seele, do you remember when Sin first arrived at the orphanage?", "61577": "Yes, Sin was behaving strangely at that time, but she was happy to interact with people. It was as if she wanted to be someone else, and she was trying her best to change herself.", "61578": "Yes, then Sin changed little by little and is now like it is now.

Your hypocritical crap makes me want to puke! If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!", "61663": "Yes, so please restore the flow of time. So that the current Sin can leave the labyrinth and return to everyone's home.", "61669": "Tsk, don't look at me like I'm Seele, with your nauseating eyes. People like you disgust me!", "61671": "You've come to stop my experiments, haven't you! Don't think for one second that I can't do anything if Mom doesn't want me to! If I knew how to do the experiments, I wouldn't need your help!", "61672": "You're still saying that after being hugged by your sister Bronya! Even Seele has never...... Never been hugged by Bronya like that!", "61673": "Whatever, go explode from jealousy. I don't care. I'm out of here, mom's waiting for me.", "61674": "Sin, do you remember the question you asked me once? You said you couldn't tell whether you were a human or a monster.", "61675": "Huh? I don't remember that, moron! I'm just me! Don't bring up the old days. I'm not a human, I'm not a monster, I'm sin incarnate! Heheheh~", "61676": "....I think she's returned to being an idiot.", "61677": "Yes, this is her answer. It is also proof that she's working towards what she wants.", "61683": "Mom, that experimental equipment is broken.  It's so easy to break. Can't you make me stronger?  At least enough to bully Seele——", "61690": "Haha, I just remembered!  Bronya's Armored Bunny is a little unstable. I guess that makes me the stronger one!", "61667": "Oi oi oi! Bronya, what are you doing!? Don't hug me, that's gross!", "63192": "That is ... Sin?  Why are you crying here?", "63193": "That is a projection of Sin's heart. It's very similar to Shin when I met her.  ...... She has a seemingly calm but endless darkness that drags others into it and even makes her look like another.", "63194": "Seele, do you remember when you first met her?", "63195": "Yeah, of course I remember. Bronya, you shouldn't approach her because she's a monster...", "63198": "Bronya, I think she's noticed me. What should I do?", "63199": "I just want to be friends with Bronya ... Why do you avoid me?  Why won't you treat me like her?", "63200": "... at that time ... at that time, Shin wasn't human.", "63201": "So how can I become someone like Bronya? I... I just wanted to be friends with Bronya!", "63204": "Hahahahaha, poor Sin! Everyone has abandoned you. You're not even a human, you're just a devil!", "63206": "You're confused now, aren't you? Life in the orphanage has erased the demon in you. Now you have to live in a peaceful orphanage, where you only find your value in killing.", "63207": "You want to suppress your desires and live as a human being, even though you're a devil? Don't make me laugh!", "63208": "That's why you need \"power\".  If you don't want to be a doll, obtain the power to make others kneel before you! The 'you' right now is worthless. If you're not killing anyone, you're nothing, because you're just a monster!", "63209": "Shut the hell up!  I'm human!  I'm not a monster!", "63210": "Look at yourself. You're not human. You'll never be human! Your whole existence is a sin. Killing is your instinct!", "63211": "Then I'll kill you too!", "63213": "Bronya, watch out!", "63216": "I'm human ... I'm human!  I'm not a monster!  Human!  I'm a monster ... I'm not a monster!!!", "63217": "Sin, let go of Bronya!", "63218": "Bronya!  Sin is confused.  It's dangerous to continue the experiment!  Seele and Bronya, I'll disconnect!", "63219": "Wait... I have to save Sin!", "63220": "Sin, push Bronya down the stairs!  This is your world!  If you kill Bronya, nobody will be able to stop you!", "63221": "Kill Bronya! The one you desire at the cost of becoming human! If you kill her, you can become yourself again! Become the real me!", "63224": "I'm a human being. ...... I'm not a monster! Why ...... does Bronya always avoid me! Why doesn't she treat me the same way she treats Seele!", "63225": "Sin... I'm sorry. You're not a monster. The one in the wrong here is me... Who was afraid of becoming a monster.", "63226": "When I first met you on that rainy night, I saw the evil reflected in your eyes. .....It felt like my heart shattered.", "63227": "Before I met you, I fought and killed to live, and dyed my hands red with blood......", "63228": "I was scared... The reflection I saw in your eyes was of a monster wearing human skin.", "63229": "So I avoided you... I was scared. But I wasn't scared of you, I was scared of what I looked like to you.", "63230": "Sin, I'm sorry.", "63232": "Sin! Why are you hesitating! Kill her already!", "63252": "For me, sin is just a shiny, pretty decoration. Hehehehe...", "63253": "Hahahaha... Enjoy your happiness while it lasts. You'll regret it one day!", "63256": "Now this is what I call a dangerous experiment. I've been underestimated by people who harass me by bringing up my past.", "63258": "Well, that's natural.", "63259": "Bronya and I approve of what happened here, and Sin's growth. You're a bit twisted, you don't get along with the kids at the orphanage as well as you should... Actually, you're quite hated. (TN: might be wrong)", "63264": "Let's get out of here. It feels terrible being in this ghost place.", "63265": "You're leaving already....?", "63276": "Hmm... I wonder what would have happened if Bronya wasn't there at the end~?", "63277": "She helped a little.  But I've done all the most troublesome battles!", "63132": "In theory.  But that's too dangerous.  You and Seele are the only two successful X-10 experiments.  I can't overdo it.", "63133": "That's right~ You two valuables can be kept in the glass cabinet~ If you break, mother will cry~", "63134": "Sin is an important force and companion of Bronya and others. If this method works, the success rate of the experiment should increase.  Mom, please.", "63135": "Certainly, it seems like it's worth a try ...  However--", "63136": "Ugh!  I don't need your compassion!", "63137": "In other words, Sin can't undergo experiments anymore. When I perform tasks in the future, it will be just me and Bronya~ It's great!", "63138": "You little...", "63139": "Sin, stop being stubborn. If you want to prove yourself, we'll just watch on the sidelines. Is that alright?", "63140": "Humph, that's fine, I don't need you to do extra things. Just look and see how invincible I am!", "63141": "I'm not very enthusiastic, but I'll allow it.  Follow me to the lab.", "63142": "The experiment started right away, the subject was Sin, and Seele and Bronya were in charge of supporting the experiment.", "63145": "I understand.", "63146": "As a reminder, in the event of an accident, we'll cut off the connection between Seele and Bronya to give priority to their safety.", "63147": "That's fine! Even without them, this experiment will be successful. In fact, I'd rather not have them getting in my way!", "63148": "Fufu... Sin, good luck. Let's start the experiment!", "63149": "Bronya, this is ... in an orphanage, right?", "63150": "It seems to be a space created by Sin's consciousness.  The same thing happened in the previous X-10 experiment.  Seele, do you remember that castle-like building?", "63154": "What is this?  I thought it was going to be scary, but it was an orphanage ... it's boring.", "63155": "I'm sure there is something behind this.  Bronya and Seele had similar experiences.  …… I have a bad feeling.  Sin, let's be careful.", "63205": "Wait! You're--"}
