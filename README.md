# ggz-cutscene-interpreter
Cutscene interpreter for Guns Girl Z / Houkai Gakuen 2nd

http://ggz.amaryllisworks.pw


# Setup
There is no automated way to dump the files yet because they're encrypted, so you must have a rooted phone and dump the game files while the game is running.

Refer to https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/random-scripts/blob/master/Guns%20Girl%20Z.md for dumping data_all.unity3d and the files needed to build.

Additionally to get images you must download the apk, add .zip at the end, and extract the embedded assetbundles.

# Build
WIP, there is no makefile yet.
